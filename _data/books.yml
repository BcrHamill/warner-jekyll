  publisher: "Vintage"
  publication_year: 1995
  blurb: "It is off-season in a remote Highland sea port: twenty-one-year-old Morvern Callar, a low-paid employee in the local supermarket, wakes one morning to find her strange boyfriend has committed suicide and is dead on their kitchen floor. Morvern's laconic reaction is both intriguing and immoral. What she does next is even more appalling...
Brutal, erotic, jarringly poetic and rich in a blood-dark humour, Morvern Callar was the spectacular debut of an utterly original Scottish writer and winner of the Somerset Maugham Award."
  quotes:
    - comment: "Warner's portrait of a Scottish rave-girl is bleak, haunting and brilliantly original"
      source: "Nick Hornby"
    - comment: "Morvern is a compelling creation; elusive, enigmatic and opaque. Both ordinary and extraordinary, she gleams out like onyx from a vivid, macabre and lyrical book"
      source: "The Guardian"
    - comment: "Not since Camus' The Outsider has a voice with so many angles hopped and fluttered from the pages, has a note risen to chill in its opening breath"
      source: "Scotland on Sunday"
    - comment: "Morvern is a brilliant creation... more than a stunning debut novel; to my mind it establishes Alan Warner as one of the most talented, original and interesting voices around"
      source: "Irvine Welsh"
    - comment: "Brilliant, tender, a stylistic dazzler"
      source: "Hilary Mantel"

  publisher: "Vintage"
  publication_year: 1997
  blurb: "A sequel to his acclaimed début Morvern Callar, These Demented Lands, confirms that Alan Warner boasts an extravagant talent... This novel is set on a Scottish island that contains a variety of weird landmarks and an hallucinogenic cast of characters - including a DJ who wants to set up the rave to end all raves, a visitor whose job is to assess candidates for sainthood and the wonderfully unfazed heroine, Morvern Callar"
  quotes:
    - comment: "Warner's second novel is a classic like his first one... glorious... powerful" 
      source: "Independent"
    - comment: "A moving evocation of post- apocalyptic rave culture in the West Highlands of contemporary Scotland"
      source: "Independent on Sunday"
    - comment: "Prodigious powers of invention... marvellously dynamic prose... brilliant visual imagination... A greatly ambitious novel"
      source: "Times Literary Supplement"
    - comment: "Think of the inventiveness of Iain Banks filtered through the lurid lens of a David Lynch, with a soundtrack from Verve and Bob Dylan... These Demented Lands is fiction 'on the Outer Rim of everything'. Rave on, child"
      source: "Scotsman"
    - comment: "With a style that fuses poetic discipline with the riff-based scat of a hedonis"
      source: "Esquire"
    - comment: "Alan Warner has a gift greater than the gift of telling a story. He can make what he chooses to tell us seem like a story we were waiting to hear"
      source: "Observer"

- title: "The Sopranos"

  publisher: "Vintage"
  publication_year: 1998
  blurb: "The choir from Our Lady of Perpetual Succour School for Girls is being bussed to the national finals in the big, big city. And it's an important day for The Sopranos - Orla, Kylah, (Ra)Chell, Amanda Konky and Fionnula (the Cooler) - pub-crawling, shoplifting and body-piercing being the top priorities. Then it's time to lose that competition - lose, because a nuclear sub has just anchored in the bay and, tonight, the Man Trap disco will be full of submariners on shore-leave."
  quotes:
    - comment: "In a spill of vivid and corruscating language... Alan Warner has emerged as a writer of great inventiveness" 
      source: "Annie Proulx"
    - comment: "Wonderful... humane, unique, a page-turner with a neat series of bombshells at the end"
      source: "Daily Telegraph"
    - comment: "Warner provides every nuance of the characters in a sustained tour de force... This is the most profound of Warner's books. His sense of place and atmosphere remains extraordinarily intense"
      source: "Guardian"
    - comment: "Wickedly funny... Warner can combine literary style with go-anywhere demotic humour... Like St Trinians with condoms and male nudity"
      source: "Independent"
    - comment: "With a style that fuses poetic discipline with the riff-based scat of a hedonis"
      source: "Esquire"
