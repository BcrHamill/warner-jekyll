  blurb: "It is off-season in a remote Highland sea port: twenty-one-year-old Morvern Callar, a low-paid employee in the local supermarket, wakes one morning to find her strange boyfriend has committed suicide and is dead on their kitchen floor. Morvern's laconic reaction is both intriguing and immoral. What she does next is even more appalling...
Brutal, erotic, jarringly poetic and rich in a blood-dark humour, Morvern Callar was the spectacular debut of an utterly original Scottish writer and winner of the Somerset Maugham Award."

    - comment: "Warner's portrait of a Scottish rave-girl is bleak, haunting and brilliantly original"
      source: "Nick Hornby"

      source: "The Guardian"
    - comment: "Not since Camus' The Outsider has a voice with so many angles hopped and fluttered from the pages, has a note risen to chill in its opening breath"
      source: "Scotland on Sunday"

This novel is set on a Scottish island that contains a variety of weird landmarks and an hallucinogenic cast of characters - including a DJ who wants to set up the rave to end all raves, a visitor whose job is to assess candidates for sainthood and the wonderfully unfazed heroine, Morvern Callar"

      source: "Times Literary Supplement"
    - comment: "Think of the inventiveness of Iain Banks filtered through the lurid lens of a David Lynch, with a soundtrack from Verve and Bob Dylan... These Demented Lands is fiction 'on the Outer Rim of everything'. Rave on, child"
      source: "Scotsman"
    - comment: "With a style that fuses poetic discipline with the riff-based scat of a hedonis"
      source: "Esquire"

And it's an important day for The Sopranos - Orla, Kylah, (Ra)Chell, Manda and Fionnula (the Cooler) - pub-crawling, shoplifting and body-piercing being the top priorities. Then it's time to lose that competition - lose, because a nuclear sub has just anchored in the bay and, tonight, the Man Trap disco will be full of submariners on shore-leave."

      source: "Daily Telegraph"

      source: "Independent"

  publisher: "Faber & Faber"
  publication_year: 2014
  blurb: "High up in the Conrad Flats that loom bleakly over Acton, two future stars of the literary scene - or so they assume - are hard at work, tapping out words of wit and brilliance between ill-paid jobs writing captions for the Cat Calendar 1985 and blurbs for trashy novels with titles like Brothel of the Vampire. Just twenty-one but already well entrenched in a life eked out on dole payments, pints and dollops of porridge and pasta, Llewellyn and Cunningham don't have it too bad: a pub on the corner, a misdirected parental allowance, and the delightful company of Aoife, Llewellyn's model fiancée, mother of his young baby - and the woman of Cunningham's increasingly vivid dreams."
  quotes:
    - comment: "[G]litteringly explosive ... the perfect summer read." 
      source: "The Times"
    - comment: "[T]his craftily engineered and winningly nostalgic novel is at last a story of lost illusions. It ends in a flash-frame of aporia, an impossible decision to be made: in lesser hands this might feel like a copout, but Warner knows exactly what he is doing."
      source: "Guardian"
    - comment: "Warner has always been the contemporary Scottish writer most interested in literary style; combining slangy, stylised speech with a baroque phrasing and syntax, he is incapable of writing a dull book."
      source: "The List"
    - comment: "Moving, funny, richly peopled and written with great gusto."
      source: "Financial Times"
    - comment: "[O]ne of Scotland's best, a writer who has begun to create his own, often surreal, imaginative world out of the flotsam and jetsam - the detritus - of modern life."
      source: "Observer"
    - comment: "[An] ebullient but underlyingly sombre book."
      source: "Sunday Times"
    - comment: "Their Lips Talk of Mischief paints a sharp picture of deception, obsession and love. It encourages runaways to look forwards rather than backwards, yet never discloses its journey's end. It shows Warner at his finest, all his talents in cahoots."
      source: "Scotland on Sunday"
    - comment: "Their Lips Talk of Mischief is that rare thing - a book about books that will actually appeal to those without literary doctorates ... this is a novel that rises above its meta self-reflexiveness to cover frustrated ambition, friendship, desire, love - and a good deal of sex ... Warner has a peculiar eye for detail that is delightful and disturbing."
