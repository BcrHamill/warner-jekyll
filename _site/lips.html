    <h4 class="book__awards"></h4> 
    <p class="book__blurb">High up in the Conrad Flats that loom bleakly over Acton, two future stars of the literary scene - or so they assume - are hard at work, tapping out words of wit and brilliance between ill-paid jobs writing captions for the Cat Calendar 1985 and blurbs for trashy novels with titles like Brothel of the Vampire. Just twenty-one but already well entrenched in a life eked out on dole payments, pints and dollops of porridge and pasta, Llewellyn and Cunningham don't have it too bad: a pub on the corner, a misdirected parental allowance, and the delightful company of Aoife, Llewellyn's model fiancée, mother of his young baby - and the woman of Cunningham's increasingly vivid dreams.</p>

    Questions contributed by Kirsten Anderson
</p>
<p class="text-bold">
    The ending leaves the reader guessing what choice Douglas will make. What was your thinking behind leaving things open and were you ever tempted towards a
    more definitive coda?
</p>

<p>Well there is this clear hint in the graveyard scene what finally happens to Lou, and I decided to make that explicit quite late on in writing the book, so I am afraid even in some quite late drafts of the novel, there really existed a “Thirty-Years-Later” coda, where Douglas visits Lou and Aoife for an afternoon in Twyford, near Reading – of all places- where Lou was an English teacher in a local comprehensive. They have had another kid - a teenage son - and Lily is a post-grad student. There was even an appearance from Lamborghini the tortoise. It was my <em>Dallas</em> “the new series” moment. What was actually odd about it, was that the emotions of the scene swerved madly around and all were unspoken. Normally that’s a good thing, but here I felt it really caused a sort of vacuum of feeling rather than a punch. It was unfocused, there was this strange paternal emotion between Lily and Douglas too, and there wasn’t enough time to explore those emotions – it was impossible to cram all the exposition which was needed into the scene. It was what made me realise I had to take definite action - so in the graveyard scene, I made a clear hint what was soon going to happen to Lou and that totally changed things and made the choice Douglas makes all the more crucial - as he will be implicated. I wanted it to be quite subtle and just dropped it in there, but in a way it is the most crucial sentence in the whole book. Sometimes though, you have to write a scene like that coda to detect exactly where the true ending of any novel is. Too many endings is such a risk for fiction. I just read two excellent novels by writers I admire, but they both had - in my opinion - tagged on not one extra scene beyond the real ending but two, or even three. Let’s face it, sometimes it’s hard to let go in life and in art. Who wants to let go, who wants to end that long saxophone solo when it sounds so good? How can you end it? Well as Miles Davis once said – just take the saxophone out of your mouth. It’s like death itself. As a writer you just get all rhetorical at the end. You imagine that when you finally croak, you will be able to nicely collect your thoughts, make a speech to the heirs of your vast estates - even if just in your own mind - formulate a nice, rounded conclusion to your time on this fair earth. But only suicides get close to that. The rest of us will be cut off, in absurdum, half way through a random act, or thought, during some unremarkable perception or in mid-dream whilst asleep. The great dramatic moment of ENDING that we all have waited on and attached such significance to our whole lives, actually evaporates and we just vanish. I hope. I could be tortured for eternity by scalpel-wielding book critics in an afterlife? Or able to read and eat pizza evermore?</p>

    The novel is set during the Thatcher years and there are a number of allusions to this social and political backdrop. To what extent are you using this
    backdrop to explain the circumstances and behaviour of the main protagonists?
</p>


<p>I don’t think I was at all. In some ways, there are parallels between Aoife’s and Abby’s relationship, and Morvern and Lanna’s: possession, deception, jealousy, revelation. I think I am exploring repeated themes in my novels, but doing so unconsciously. To be bland, for me there are just always things going on with humans that as a novelist, I want to chip away at - what James Kennaway called, “that caveman stuff going on beneath.” That is what is so fascinating about reading novels from other ages – the continuity of certain human traits and obsessions placed inside a greater scenario. I am not trying to suggest that an abstract, continuous human nature exists, but it is so interesting – if <em>Their Lips Talk of Mischief</em> had been set in 1964, 1944, 1884 or 1774, what would the historical setting do to the characters motivations and conflicts?</p>

<p>I have a prediction this will turn in to a tirade, but I wanted to set the novel in 1984 because I lived in London as a student during that period and I saw the start of Thatcherism, the miners’ strike, the beginning of social changes and the twisting of social ideology which I have been ill at ease with for so long. The idea that “Finance is the Future,” emerged then as the social ideal, rather than traditional manufacturing. And not just during the Thatcher era, with the emergence of so-called globalism, it became even more extreme in the Blair/Brown years of illegal wars.  British society is meant to be serving all its citizens for a common good. This has been increasingly undermined with brainwashing that we all exist only to serve and succeed in a finance-based monetary economy, (or “fail”), not to be equal members of a decent society. Ideas of a common good in society have been obscured and suppressed by an obsessional worship of - and an unquestioned authority of - the free market and profit making, the needs of big business, balancing budgets for some people - but not for all.  “Wealth Creation,” which by definition means tons for some and little for most. Every single thing is now meant to produce a profit and that is just illogical thinking. Essentially, many large businesses have become nothing more than parasites on society. Today we are all more and more, servants of an unpredictable economy which makes immediate demands on the individual, yet promises less and less in return. This isn’t progress. The promises and security of the welfare state in the Britain which came out of the second-world-war are being junked, while money is lavished on other things, like broken banks and Trident. The welfare state, the social contract and health service on these islands is a remarkable thing if you compare it with many other countries, and it needs protection, and it needs us to be proud of it – not to sell it out. We don’t just have corrupt banks, we have food banks, dodgy loan companies replacing the functions of state Social Security, failed and deadly hospitals (Stafford for instance), massive quality differences in state schooling. The usual liberal hobby horses I know, but to question all of this is not to be seen as a ‘liberal,’ but as some sort of cranky communist radical or worse: a dreamer. It really has become the society of spectacle which Guy Debord very astutely depicted. Of course the novel with its remorseless emphasis on individual psychology, is the perfect tool for undermining this society of false spectacle. And the spectacular hypocrisy after decades of this monetarist ideology which originated in the 80s, is the way the free market mantra was soon forgotten by its high priests the instant the banks went arse-over-tit in 2008, due to their own reckless greed, which provided huge and instant personal rewards for top executives. Suddenly not only the institutions themselves, but certain bankers and others in the financial services industry wanted - and got - their huge personal pay and bonuses doled out, not through profit, but gratis of the ordinary tax payer. MP’s can fiddle expenses and mostly escape with no criminal charges, bankers in institutions riddled with shady activities, can receive massive subsidy and huge personal bonuses from the tax payer. But someone on the dole down on the estate is always just a revolting scrounger. We know the truth now: when things go well for the free marketers, they put the money in their pockets, when things go wrong for them, they scream for the state purse to help them out, and it does. Now I am not an anarchist, though I admire its sentiments and I am deeply suspicious of The State (which is less sinister, than just a gravy train from conformists and employees of ‘State plc’ - jobs in the “security” services etc). Yet I believe in the need for law, I am not a communist. I don’t mind an airline captain or a skilled brain surgeon who has studied for decades, receiving a huge wage. I want my brain surgeon and pilot to be well paid! But I object to a money-obsessed individual who worshipped the free market and then bust his bank through greed and incompetence, getting a massive bonus paid out of public funds which I contribute to - while other people must go to food banks or disabled people are told to move house and lose their spare room. The Royal Bank of Scotland is 81% owned by the tax payer. It is virtually like British Rail used to be, but the RBS is nationalised due to it failings - not for structural reasons. Even though the RBS made a £1 billion loss in 2010, in the same year it still gave out staff bonuses totalling around £1 billion - including around 100 senior members receiving individual bonuses of over one million pounds – each! There could be an argument that this is a form of theft. The bank was cabbaged, but these people still felt, despite their failures, entitled to this payment - and were given it. Try that one down the dole: “I’d like a million quid please.” Yet it’s exactly the same thing. All of this was funded by us. Meanwhile ‘austerity’ for the disabled and others is a necessary and good idea! This makes a joke of austerity policies. But nothing was done. Bonuses continue to be paid. In 2011, The Royal Bank of Scotland was fined £28.5 million for ‘anti-competitive practises.’</p>

<p>As I respond to this question in May 2015, JB Morgan Chase, Citigroup Barclays and our friends, The Royal Bank of Scotland have just plead guilty to criminal charges and have been fined almost 4 billion pounds for their illegal activities in the United States. The Royal Bank of Scotland’s own share of the fine is £254 million. This is a company based in Edinburgh. This is why I strongly believe it was so deeply hypocritical and morally wrong that - as a state owned company, beholden to us all in a debt of gratitude - the Royal Bank of Scotland - in my definition, a bent institution, plotted in what was a blatant politically motivated manner. It operated in cooperation with the No campaign, to influence the vote in the Scottish Independence referendum. And they no doubt succeeded. By threatening to leave the country which it is meant to be a responsible and proud part of, the RBS showed what shabby, unexamined morals exist there. The audacity and the contempt for the people of Scotland is frankly staggering.</p>

<p>The London based libor rate manipulation by Deutsche Bank resulted in a fine of £1.7 billion - but not a single senior executive there had to resign. Many, many other disturbing banking shenanigans show us how institutionally corrupt our financial system has become. This was the same libor rate that you may recall from 2009, which the BBC were so fond of regularly reporting on, as if it was a horse race in progress - telling us how important it was, how the interbank lending rate affected all of us and our mortgages (which it did) and how, until the banks started lending to one another again this nasty recession might continue a little while longer, etc, etc. Strangely the BBC soon lost interest in frothing over the libor rate and the amazing manipulation of it was not heavily reported when it was finally exposed.</p>

<p>To cut this short. Do the bankers with their bonuses and the person at the food bank really live in the same society and exist by same rules anymore? They do not. The rules have been perverted into a non-stop, unlimited rip off. This is a direct line from what I saw starting in 1984.</p>

<p class="text-bold">
    How do you feel about the many comparisons to <em>Withnail and I</em> that this novel has received? Whilst the novel is permeated with a great deal of
    humour based on the behaviour and antics of the main characters, to what extent would you agree that one of the more serious themes in the novel is the
    development (or lack of development) of individual conscience and personal responsibility?
</p>


<p>I am not sure the development of a conscience or personal responsibility is a theme of mine. That’s for the bankers to concentrate on! When I am thinking about a novel, I sort of live it out in my head to a great extent. I see it happening in my head. Totally. But I also see alternative versions. I am sure this is going to happen or I want that to happen. She will say that, he will reply this. It lives quite intently in my head for a spell but then of course I start to write it and things – emphasis especially, can change. I don’t think I have ever thought to myself, “The theme of this will be this.” It all seems to stem from the characters. It is almost like you take a photograph of a street with shadows on a winter evening and then someone says to you, “Was depression your theme in this photo?” No. I had no theme, I just took the photo. I don’t want to seem glib or evasive, but that is sometimes how it feels.</p>

<p>I’ll take it as a compliment for the book to be mentioned in the company of a great film - and writer. Of course Withnail influenced me. Bruce Robinson is a wonderful writer and director, and a fascinating man. I adore Withnail, but I’m am also a big fan of Robinson’s forgotten movie, How To Get Ahead in Advertising. I do wonder though if there is a wee bit of pop-culture laziness, of non-literary response going on with book critics. I thought there were more obvious literary comparisons - which I happily admit to - like J.P. Donleavy’s novel <em>The Ginger Man</em> and its main character, Sebastian Dangerfield. I even recall saying to a pal who had asked what I was writing, that it was, ‘sort of The Ginger Man in 80s London.’ It was the idea of the bookish, flighty male character, vacillating between remorse and indulgence towards his lover, between seething lust and the call of duty: that awful conflict between the love for an infant child and the egotistical world of literary fulfilment. All that made me think of Sebastian Dangerfield - not Withnail. Withnail is rather hard to think of in terms of fatherhood; can you imagine him even trying to be a father? Oh dear. His solecism is so massive he couldn’t hold it down for a moment. But he is a masterpiece, because within him are the fears of every needy thespian. But what Cunningham, Abby, Lou and Aoife are doing, is trying to work their way through the requirements of friendship, relationships and the responsibilities of caring for an infant child. I think Lou does do his best to live up to his responsibilities, though obviously he doesn’t do very well at it. He is fallible as we all are. Lou does love his daughter, but he is being pulled in many directions – including, rightly, by fear of death. I would also add that I think there are a few other ingredients in the soup: the spirit of Branwell Bronte - the great underachiever - is always a fascination with me: a male screw up in an amazing family. I reckon there’s a good bit of Orwell’s great <em>Keep the Aspidistra Flying</em> in there too. And Flann O’Brien of course. The early manuscript carried an epigraph from <em>At Swim…:</em> “There are two ways to make big money, he said, to write a book or to make a book.” And also there is Bellow’s <em>Von Humboldt Fleisher</em>. I mean it’s bloody years since I read those books, but you know fine some parts of them have – so to speak - broken off inside you.</p>

<p>Donleavy is currently unfashionable among the reputation-makers, but I think he has a fine style and I like all his stuff, including the recent work, <em>The Lady Who Liked Clean Restrooms</em> and <em>Wrong Information is Being Given Out at Princeton</em>. Good titles. At a ripe old age, he’s still living at Westmeath in that big house of his and I raise my pint to him.</p>

<p>When I first went to live in Dublin - in 1997 - like the good tourist I am, I immediately began draining many pints of Guinness in all the great old Dublin pubs - especially ones with literary associations. I began re-reading my favourite Irish books. I should have been paid a monthly stipend by the Irish Tourist Board. Hiding the title, I reread <em>Dubliners</em> stories in the back-parlour of Mulligans in Poolbeg Street, which is seemingly unchanged from the day of that great story <em>‘Counterparts’</em>, when the drunken clerk goes there on a pub crawl and arm wrestles; right there in the back parlour, where I was sitting. I found it remarkable, almost dreamlike that those pubs of Beckett and Joyce and Kavanagh were hardly changed in the mid-90s. I used to read the poems of John Berryman in the very pub where he wrote some of them, Ryan’s Beggars Bush on Haddington Road. I recall once, being on a U.S. book tour, arriving at the airport in Minneapolis and the young lady driving the car asked if there was anything I wished to see, so I immediately replied, ‘Prince’s studio and the bridge Berryman jumped off, please.’</p>

<p>That was a bloody great life back then, happy days - through Dublin I followed the changing addresses of Beckett, Wilde, Moore and Paddy Kavanagh, and all those locations of <em>Ulysses</em>.</p>

<p>And I had a wild synchronicity in Dublin when I re-read <em>The Ginger Man</em>. I had first read it in Oban in 1981 or 82 and of course, I embraced it as I was just warming the chestnuts of my own pretentions to try and become a writer. I had only retained a vague memory of the atmosphere of <em>The Ginger Man</em> - but one afternoon at home in Dublin, I sat down and began re-reading it after a gap of seventeen or eighteen years. We were then living in Howth in north Dublin, in this great apartment overlooking the sea on the Balscadden Road. To my amazement, in <em>The Ginger Man</em>’s second chapter you will read that Sebastian Dangerfield is also living right on the same Balscadden Road in Howth, yards from where I happened to be sitting.</p>

<p>I have lots of odd reading tales like that. You know when I first read <em>Finnegan’s Wake</em> I was at the University in Glasgow. I had hauled the Faber edition around with me for a few years, down to London and back up again, and while I am addicted to <em>Ulysses</em> and find it easy to read, I was a bit intimidated by The Wake – I carried it around for years but kept putting off starting to read the first page. I was also aware, from reading Robert Anton Wilson, of all the strange, personal associations you can find in its frothed up language. So I finally sat down with a cup of coffee and began reading it in Hillhead, Glasgow. On the very first page of Finnegan’s Wake, you will find the word: Hillhead.</p>

<p>I had an even spookier experience once with a Bob Shaw sci-fi novel in a rented cottage near Oban, but I will spare you the details - you wouldn’t believe me.</p>

    I am not sure the development of a conscience or personal responsibility is a theme of mine. That’s for the bankers of 2008 to concentrate on! When I am
    thinking about a novel, I sort of live it out in my head to a great extent. I almost see it happening in my head. I am sure this is going to happen or I
    want that to happen. She will say that, he will reply this. It lives quite intently in my head for a spell but then of course I start to write it. I don’t
    think I have ever thought to myself, “The theme of this will be this.” It all seems to stem from the characters. It is almost like you take a photograph of
    a street with shadows on a winter evening and then someone says to you, “Was depression your theme in this photo?” No. I had no theme, I just took the
    photo. I don’t want to seem glib or evasive, but that is sometimes how it feels.
</p>
<p>
    I’ll take it as a compliment for the book to be mentioned in the company of a great film - and writer. Bruce Robinson is a wonderful writer and director,
    and a fascinating man. I adore Withnail but I am also a big fan of Robinson’s forgotten movie, <em>How T0 Get Ahead in Advertising</em>. I do wonder though
    if there is a wee bit of pop-culture laziness - of non-literary response - going on with book critics there. I thought there were more obvious literary
    comparisons - which I happily admit to - like JP Donleavy’s novel <em>The Ginger Man</em> and its main character, Sebastian Dangerfield. I even recall
    saying to a pal who had asked what I was writing, that it was, ‘sort of <em>The Ginger Man</em> in 80s London.’ It was the idea of the bookish, flighty
    male character, vacillating between remorse and indulgence towards his lover, between seething lust and the call of duty: that awful conflict between the
    love for an infant child and the egotistical world of literary fulfilment. All that made me think of Sebastian Dangerfield - not Withnail. Withnail is
    rather hard to think of in terms of fatherhood; can you imagine him even trying to be a father? Oh dear. His solecism is so massive he couldn’t hold it
    down for a moment. But what Cunningham, Abby, Lou and Aoife are doing, is trying to work their way through the requirements of friendship, relationships
    and the responsibilities of caring for an infant child. I think Lou does do his best to live up to his responsibilities, though obviously he doesn’t do
    very well at it. He is fallible as we all are. Lou does love his daughter, but he is being pulled in many directions – including, rightly, by fear of
    death. I would also add that I think there are a few other ingredients in the soup: the spirit of Branwell Bronte - the great underachiever - is always a
    fascination with me, a male fuck up in an amazing family. I reckon there’s a good bit of Orwell’s great <em>Keep the Aspidistra Flying</em> in there too.
    And Flann O’ Brien of course.
</p>
<p>
    Donleavy is currently unfashionable among the reputation-makers in London and Ireland, but I think he has a fine style and I like all his stuff, even the
    recent work. At a ripe old age, he’s still living at Westmeath in that big house of his and I raise my pint to him.
</p>
<p>
    When I first went to live in Dublin - in 1997 - like the good tourist I am, I immediately began draining many pints of Guinness in all the great old Dublin
    pubs - especially ones with literary associations. I began re-reading my favourite Irish books. I should have been paid a monthly stipend by the Irish
    Tourist Board. I reread <em>Dubliners</em> in the back-parlour of Mulligans in Poolbeg Street, which is seemingly unchanged from the day of that great
    story ‘Counterparts,’ when the drunken clerk goes there on a pub crawl and arm wrestles; right there, where I was sitting. I found it remarkable, almost
    dreamlike that those pubs of Beckett and Joyce and Kavanagh were hardly changed. I used to read the poems of another American – John Berryman - in the very
    pub where he wrote some of them, Ryan’s Beggars Bush on Haddington Road. (I recall once, being on a U.S. book tour, arriving at the airport in Minneapolis
    and the young lady driving the car asked if there was anything I wished to see so I replied, ‘Prince’s studio and the bridge Berryman jumped off, please’).
</p>
<p>
    That was a bloody great life back then, happy days - through Dublin I followed the changing addresses of Beckett, Wilde, Moore and Paddy Kavanagh, and all
    those locations of <em>Ulysses</em>.

<p class="text-bold">Abby is sexually uninhibited and confident, whereas Aoife is seemingly very naive and at one point even asks Douglas to explain sexual positions to her. Did you want to use the two women to reflect the extent to which the male protagonists develop self-consciousness about the impact of their lifestyle, behaviour and actions? Or did you intend for readers to view Aoife as much more manipulative than she appears to be on the surface?</p>


<p>I see what you are saying, but I don’t believe I would develop any character just to reflect an aspect of other characters. That’s what Mrs Micawber does, says she will never abandon Mr Micawber and she doesn’t. But that’s all she does as a character. Characters for me have to do their best to come alive as autonomous people on the page then bounce off each other, (Not literally, though I suppose a lot of that does go on in <em>Their Lips Talk of Mischief</em>). To me, Aoife and Abby are just two high school mates who know each other inside out and came down to London together - to make it in the big city - yet they are still capable of that element of surprise for one another – which I think can be true of friendship and all its attendant jealousies. It is when friendships are tested that the truth of their nature begins to emerge.</p>

<p>You have to be careful as a fiction writer that you don’t end up with just a load of louche characters who the reader does not care about, jumping into and out of beds with one another. That’s the problem of pornography. The world is never just about sex and nothing else - but porn pretends – like some ridiculous fairy tale - that it is; it pretends that no reality exists beyond sex. That might be why I find the set pieces, the furniture and the rooms in which visual pornography takes place, strangely compelling and more fascinating than then sexual acts depicted. That’s why I liked that book by Catherine Millet so much, it wasn’t really about sex at all; it was about philosophy and need, and personal psychology. Salter’s beautiful <em>A Sport & a Pastime</em> is similar – a novel about sex, but really about far more – about fantasy and narrative and love. There has to be a meaning as to why characters bed hop. I don’t think to get through modern life the best idea is joining a sex cult, and I don’t think we are best taking a vow of celibacy either. The ideal is somewhere in between! So I don’t share Abby and Aoife’s preciousness about the sexual act – though you will note that both of them do seem to enjoy – with gusto - breaking the rules when they finally do. Despite that, I think we have to cut Aoife and Lou some slack. They are young and vivacious, but they have been hobbled by an accidental pregnancy and youthful parenthood. That is a huge thing to cope with and I felt a lot of reviews about <em>Their Lips Talk of Mischief</em> (but not Brian Morton’s, in The Scottish Review of Books) overlooked the importance of parenthood in the book and its demanding, hourly requirements. The looming presence of baby Lily was very important – I mean morally important to me; but a lot of reviewers - even very favourable ones - overlooked that.</p>

<p class="text-bold">Lou is painted by our narrator, Douglas, to be violent and neglectful, and undeserving of Aoife’s love. Which is of course manipulative, given Douglas’ actions later on when he embarks on an affair with her. However, it could also be argued that Lou knew exactly what he was doing when he invited Douglas to live with them and left him alone with his wife for long periods. After all, he was bored and looking for excitement and perhaps a way out of the relationship, without the guilt. Who do you see as the master manipulator in this novel? The “evil” one, to whom the title refers?</p>


<p>Lou is a mercurial guy, so I could be wrong here. But I really don’t think Lou invited Douglas into their home as bait - to have an affair with Aoife. It’s a possible interpretation, but I think Lou is just too egotistical for that. It’s okay for him to have affairs, but he is far too jealous to allow Aoife to have one. Or for Douglas and he to contemplate living with Aoife in a menage - as she seems to suggest at one point as a possibility. Is this what will happen if Douglas moves in with them at Granny Smith’s old house when the novel ends? It is a hanging point. What would Lou have actually done if he found out about Douglas and Aoife? Maybe if he had, it would have brought him to some realisation for the better? Maybe the tragedy here will turn out to be the deceit and no more.</p>

<p>I am not sure that Douglas is such an unreliable narrator – the entire novel seems to amount to some kind of confession where he was simply unable to reveal his final act of indulgence and recklessness – though my personal feeling is that I am damn sure the choice Douglas made in the end, which I think led to the tragedy for Lou hinted at in the graveyard. Of course we witness everything that happens through the perspective of Douglas, but a great deal of his narration leaves interpretation open for the reader. It is as much what Douglas doesn’t write about – what he leaves blank for the reader to fill in- which signals where his guilt and paranoia lies, rather than what he is overt about. When Douglas and Aoife shack up together while Lou is away teaching at that language school, we don’t have extensive daily descriptions of Aoife’s and Douglas’s little private honeymoon. As well as having sex, Aoife and Douglas must be having at least some conversations – but of course those conversations are never reported. Yet Douglas finds himself abandoned the minute Lou returns to London for the funeral. I do think though, that Douglas is trying hard to tell the truth about things – he is showing us boldly and not without self-hatred, the lengths people –especially himself - will go to in the spell of lust, in the desire to possess another. Douglas shows what he will do to get what he wants or...to get what he thinks he wants - but isn’t quite sure until he tries it. People are often surprised to hear me say that although I comprehensively detest Lou’s outbreak of violence towards Aoife, I often feel Douglas is the real villain of this novel. Lou struggles very openly with all his worries but Douglas is a bit of a smiler with a knife. Yet I am not sure I would endorse him or anyone as ‘evil’. In a sense, the title is ironic – in the case of strict morality, we are all modern sinners and evil-doers. All of our lips talk of mischief constantly. I don’t think there is a master manipulator here unless it is a god or a devil. They all have a go, but I think it bites them all back – only baby Lily is innocent.</p>
