    <p class="book__blurb">The choir from Our Lady of Perpetual Succour School for Girls is being bussed to the national finals in the big, big city. And it's an important day for The Sopranos - Orla, Kylah, (Ra)Chell, Amanda Konky and Fionnula (the Cooler) - pub-crawling, shoplifting and body-piercing being the top priorities. Then it's time to lose that competition - lose, because a nuclear sub has just anchored in the bay and, tonight, the Man Trap disco will be full of submariners on shore-leave.</p>

    <h4 class="book__subheader text-light">QUESTIONS WITH THE AUTHOR</h4>
    <p>
    Questions contributed by Lewis Gordon
</p>
<p class="text-bold">
    The narrator in <em>The </em><em>Sopranos</em> is incredibly fluid - from sentence to sentence fleeting through linguistic registers, and colluding with
    various characters. Did you find this voice instinctively or was it a challenge to smooth over the joins?
</p>
<p>
    I remember having various impressions about the narrator. Firstly, I believed the narrator was a younger woman from the same culture as the girls, but
    older than them - in her late 20s, early 30s maybe. The second thing was, I felt she had studied philosophy then suddenly become disgusted with it. As it
    seems Finn later will. I also felt she sort of disapproved of the girls at the start of the novel, but gradually came to be on their side, as if the
    narrative voice was won over by the girls. A slow arc of approval developed.
</p>
<p>
    Many people still just assume that the narrative voice is the voice of the author. A lot of the time it is. You might assume that in say Greene, Kerouac –
    maybe – but it is probably more complex than that. I feel if you give your narrator certain attitudes, even very small, subtle things which are at a
    tangent, it’s remarkable how it colours the whole narrative. I mean you can take it to an absurd degree. You could say, Okay, the narrative voice is mine
    BUT, I will pretend I am phobic about the colour blue. Then in your novel you would have all these odd, heightened descriptions of the sky and of the sea,
    or a character’s eyes and it would give this odd resonance to the narrative
</p>
<p class="text-bold">
    How do music references find their way into your writing? In <em>The </em><em>Sopranos</em> there are some great moments with Kylah's musical obsessions
    and <em>He Loved Him Madly</em> is a perfect soundtrack to <em>Morvern Callar</em>. Do you listen to music as you work?
</p>
<p>
    I guess I am a bit of an obsessional music lover, so I have to take care with my obsession. If music is mentioned in the text I try not to let it overwhelm
    a narrative. If you mention music, it must serve some sort of function within the story. In Morvern, I thought the careful music lists reflected her
    methodical, practical disposition, the same way she obsessively details exactly what she eats, what sexual positions she adopts, how often she lights a
    cigarette and how she coordinates the disposal of her dead boyfriend’s dismembered corpse. I liked the sort of prosaic, methodical menace she exuded and in
    a way this justified her precision over the music lists.
</p>
<p>
    In <em>The Worms Can Carry Me to Heaven</em>, there was no mention of music at all; Manolo was a character I deliberately gave the trait that he doesn’t
    like music, though I recall, me-being-me, there was a long chapter trying to explain why he didn’t like music, where he described going to an orchestral
    concert in Madrid and hating it. I edited the chapter out because of course, I was just using it as an excuse to write about music in a book not meant to
    have anything about music in it.
</p>
<p>
    I am cautious and insufferably fussy about listening to music while I am working. I use CDs playing in my study to tempt myself to the desk, then I let
    them run out and try not to put a new one on. I have the the usual, oft-quoted reason for not writing with music playing while I write – or more
    accurately, try to write - which I know other writers experience. You think it is your wonderful writing that is dynamic, or emotionally moving on the
    page, but it’s actually the music that gives your dead prose a lift. You read back your moving sequence and it doesn’t work at all; you recognise it was
    the music which made you feel those things behind the writing. Music allows you to fool yourself better.
</p>
<p>
    Sometimes as I write I do have electronic music on, or very thinned out music with no beat. Something that I can’t actually listen closely to and which
    must be monotonous. Some of Brian Eno’s music is great for that. Even when I was a student in 1984 I used to listen to his ‘Discreet Music’ and ‘On Land,’
    late at night when my girlfriend was sleeping. ‘Neroli’ and I think it’s called, ‘Thursday Afternoon’ are great. These are pieces Eno made especially for
    CD and about 70 mins long, so you don’t have to get up every 35 minutes and push the CD play switch again - so that keeps my ass sat at the desk - which is
    where you want it to be, not circling the room like a water-diviner as I usually am, polishing the picture frames and staring out the window.
</p>
<p>
    Eno’s a bit of a wonder isn’t he? I loved his music from when I was 15 years old and we bought this vinyl double album: <em>Here Come the Warm Jets</em>
    and <em>Before and After Science, </em>stuck together as a double album for the price of one. You listen to all the stuff Eno did, from Roxy through the
    early 70s and he broke so many barriers, established so many things far ahead of his contemporaries. More-or less, you hear all of New Wave music in Eno’s
    first three albums, between 1973 and 75. Anyway, his electronic music is good to write to. Or maybe ‘Great Expectations,’ this track by Miles Davis which
    is again a long track, very monotonous and very influential – Bill Laswell is cool, a great live bass player, but Bill must have made ten whole albums just
    based on ‘Great Expectations’! I also have this rare recording, <em>Chitinous</em> by a genius English composer called Paul Buckmaster and his girlfriend
    Diana Lewis, which is good to listen to for writing – it’s these sort of repeating cycles; he is a talented arranger who used to work with Leonard Cohen
    and Elton John but he is really far out. I can also write to Messiaen’s thing: ‘Quartet for the End of Time,’ or I can have something by Stockhausen or his
    sons in the background that isn’t too abrasive. Music you can give your attention to if you wish but you can also ignore. All of this is just to give some
    atmosphere to my study, because the sound of the study’s demanding silence can be a bit intimidating, especially first thing in the day. I could never
    listen to the radio – even good old Off the Ball or something like that while working, this would be impossible for a drama queen like me.
</p>
<p class="text-bold">
    There is a cryptic reference to "the St. Tequila's Convent Girls" in the acknowledgements at the end of the book. Did you do any particular research
    into writing the female dialogue - which forms a huge part of the story - or just write from your own gut, memories and experience?
</p>
<p>
    Being honest, your phrase, ‘gut, memories and experience’ just perfectly sums it up. I mean I can give you some background to the genesis of the book. That
    was when I was living in Ireland which I did for many, many years and the St Tequila thing is a reference to my wife, Hollie-Lisa and her mates. Hollie at
    the time, was about 19 and you know, we were running wild around Dublin and Wicklow. Tequila shots were often involved. Hollie and her mates attended an
    all-girl state convent school in Ireland – and they had mostly just left the school or were even still in it or going up to college or Uni or had jobs in
    the small town we lived near. There had been a school choir and they would tell me all these stories about it, so it was from hanging out with them I got
    the idea. I mean <em>The Sopranos</em> shows how completely fictional my work is. It’s a simple fact that while Oban is a starting point for my fiction,
    there is no way that novel could possibly be set in a realistic Oban. The simple fact is that the Catholic population in Oban is far too small to support a
    large school that - never mind boys - only contains Catholic girls. There did used to be a small Catholic High School in Oban in the 70s, but it was
    completely amalgamated into the local comprehensive. There was a convent in town where you could see the nuns in their white habits moving mysteriously
    around their garden. And when I was a little boy in 1969, a submarine did come to anchor in Oban bay and members of the public could go out to visit it.
    That section I seem to recall in the novel, comparing the submarine to Jonah’s whale is there because I was so young someone teased me - maybe my sister -
    that it wasn’t a submarine, it was a whale, and when my father and I went out in the launch to board the submarine I became very afraid that it was indeed
    a whale and I would have to go inside it. I recall all that quite clearly and I remember the pink ambient light inside the thing, like a huge alimentary
    canal. I thought it was horrible and oppressive. Even at 4 years old, I realized Trident was a load of bad, expensive bullshit!
</p>
<p>
    I am also very interested in the idea of holy shrines, pilgrimage sites and the commercial exploitation of them which what you might call the subplot of
    Father Ardlui in the novel. It was a theme I thought might form a whole novel, the blasphemous creation and promotion of a new sacred site. That was how
    the priest subplot came about. I admit also that of course people had been saying to me “You write female characters well,” so I thought I would take all
    these elements and invent a female teenage gang, a school choir, going down to Edinburgh for just the day. A whole novel set in twenty four hours. So it is
    a weird amalgamation. I had to invent a large Catholic population in the Port and give a lot of the girls Irish-sounding names to sort of back up the idea
    of a larger Catholic community. I mean you could argue it’s all completely inauthentic – it is a total world of imagination, yet with this weird hard edge
    to it all.
</p>
<p class="text-bold">
    Did you enjoy writing any specific Soprano more than the others?
</p>
<p>
    I don’t recall that, no. I mean it was a bit nutty writing that novel. It was a bit like having six younger sisters and I was locked in a linen closet with
them and their voices, going. I mean they all talk. A lot! And I had that in my head for a year. But when I came to write    <em>The Stars in the Bright Sky</em>, it was weird the way Manda took over that novel. All that stuff you might raise your eyebrows at when you see writers
    bellyaching on: “Oh yes, the character just wrote himself” - but it was really like that with Manda, she had just had sort of matured in her levels of
    obnoxiousness. But I liked her.
</p>
<p class="text-bold">
    The singing competition - the whole purpose of the Sopranos' journey to the capital - happens off the page. Was there ever an attempt to write this
    scene?
</p>
<p>
    That’s a very interesting point which I had totally forgotten about. As you say, the narrative was pressing towards this flashpoint but I believe it became
    just too obvious to show it. I was sure by then it would seem that disaster for the choir’s performance was inevitable. It was going to be a car crash
    choir final, and I think by skipping it, I threw the reader forward in the narrative and sometimes that’s what you need to do, just throw things on ahead.
    There is also something in the fact that the girls - or at least the sopranos - are so utterly disinterested in the choir competition – they just want to
    be in the big, exciting city – that they were never in the least concerned about the eventual outcome of the competition anyway. They were indifferent,
    though probably even they didn’t think it would be quite as awful as it obviously was. The girls are threatened with expulsion from their school not
    because of losing the choir final, but for changing out of their school uniforms (and losing them) and for getting drunk in Edinburgh. And for Kay vomiting
    just before they go on. I think that’s why I showed the girls singing in unison right at the beginning of the novel when they are gathered in the square,
    then we see them singing in rehearsal at the concert hall when they spy the couple making love outside the window. I must have known then that there was
    going to be no depiction of the final, awful performance and I am sure I never wrote that scene. I guess I felt it was almost a bit corny to show the final
    shame of the choir. Similarly, I didn’t show the confrontational scene – in some ways for me, the dramatic crux of the novel - when the priest, Father
    Ardlui, asks the girls to pretend they have had an ecstatic vision of the Virgin Mary. Which, despite their wildness, they refuse to do. Deep down of
    course, I find this concept very funny.
</p>
<p>
    Your question is very illustrative of what a novel is - and here is a point. In 1998, even before it was published, <em>The Sopranos</em> film rights were
    auctioned in a Hollywood deal through the big CAA agency and all that. They were finally purchased, not by a studio but because I liked him, by the
Scottish film director Michael Caton-Jones. Michael is a very interesting guy who made all these really smart movies, <em>Scandal</em> and    <em>This Boy’s Life</em> based on the great Tobias Wolff book, he also made <em>Doc Hollywood</em> and <em>Rob Roy</em>. Mike’s an interesting guy, the son
    of a coal miner from Broxburn outside Edinburgh, a punk rocker down in London in 1977 who became a roadie in the theatre, ended up at film school and
    eventually a successful director in Hollywood. The movie of <em>The Sopranos</em> never happened - which is a book all in itself. All credit goes to
    Michael, who really stood by his guns against the studios and potential financiers who wanted to change things. But it’s not fair just to blame shadowy
    baddies. Once again it was a very, very difficult novel to adapt and I am not sure we ever got the screenplay right. Alan Sharp, who was a brilliant
    Scottish screenplay writer and wrote interesting novels in the 1960s, did a remarkable screenplay of <em>The Sopranos</em>. (Sadly, Alan recently passed
    away). Alan did fantastic things with the structure – the formal problems of how to assemble a movie which all takes place in one day; but I think there
    were some things that didn’t work about the characters in Alan’s version. Then Michael or a studio commissioned me to take a stab at the screenplay myself.
    I found it extremely difficult, but I mention all this as it is interesting how in both Alan Sharp’s version and in my screenplay, the car crash choir
    final scene was <em>always </em>included. Or in other words invented. That shows the difference between the two forms. If you tried to leave out the choir
    final scene in a movie then the audience would ask the way they don’t in a novel: ‘What happened? Why wasn’t that shown?’ The whole movie would suddenly
    become about what you did not see back at that choir final. You would have to flashback and you don’t want that fouling the forward motion of the film
    narrative. I think in my screenplay version of the choir final, Kay projectile-vomited across the shoulders of the others and into the front audience row,
    whilst they all bravely crashed onward, through Forth Let the Cattle Roam.
</p>
<p>
    Another point if I may. I now believe one of the main reasons that we could never get the screenplay of <em>The Sopranos</em> to fully work is because we
    all dumped the sub plot about Father Ardlui and his nutty attempt to blackmail the girls into lying that they all experienced a religious vision of the
    Holy Mother. At the time I myself thought – ‘right, the first thing we will junk from the screenplay is this whole priest, pilgrimage, holy vision, sub
    plot stuff – we don’t need all that.’ Alan Sharp had jettisoned it too. But I think that was a big mistake of mine. I think the dramatic moment when the
    girls reject Father Ardlui’s attempt to get them to lie is very important. It gives a spine to the story which has been running right through it. It
    wouldn’t have taken that many scenes to create it – not only is it a moral dramatic crux, we gave up a real font of visual possibilities which we could
    have had fun with as Father Ardlui himself imagined how it was all going to look. Maybe we could have got some Vatican funding too? By the way, I don’t
    believe this novel is an attack on the church. It is back to that idea of having themes. I wouldn’t start a novel thinking: ‘As my theme I will attack the
    church’. I just wanted to tell a wee story about how young people really are, not how the church would wish them to be. I have talked with a few practising
    Catholics who were open-minded enough to read the novel and they cautiously agreed with me, especially about the final refusal of the girls to lie about
    the vision. It is interesting that it is this line that these liberated girls finally refuse to cross. It is a novel about wild youth and mad individuals,
    I don’t see it as an attack on an institution - though I can understand it might offend and be thought of in that manner.
</p>
<p class="text-bold">
    There are so many mini-stories and episodes in the book that spring from nowhere and could surely be fleshed out into great short stories in their own
    right. The Man and his hash-hunting budgie and the toe-severing incident are just two examples. Does this all crawl from the imagination or do you ever
    borrow from real life?
</p>
<p>
    I was talking about this a bit in relation to <em>Morvern Callar</em> and the same applies, but you seem to have stumbled on a truth as the toe-severing
    incident is indeed true and happened to a friend of mine who will remain comfortably anonymous. In fact he is a source of constant inspiration, this fine
    gentleman. Obviously it’s juggled around a lot and changed. There was no octopus ink, but he did basically perform a naked handstand to try and impress one
    of the wiser sex and promptly in an uncool way, crashed to the floor and sliced off a substantial bit of toe on a bike part. Despite that scene’s root in
    reality though, you will notice there are recurring incidents of dismemberments and mutilations throughout my jolly books. It fascinates me in a horrific
    way, yet I am very squeamish. The budgie thing is completely made up. I am actually extremely protective about animals. Like all dangerous subversives, I’m
    in the RSPCA. My wife and I did have a menagerie of six lovely colourful budgerigars in Ireland. I used to travel around with them in their big cage in the
    back of my car, driving from Dublin to Edinburgh. What a bloody racket they made. I am a sucker for pets and I am hopelessly devoted to them, like our cat.
    I can lose sleep worrying about hungry cats and dogs in the street. I am such a softy. I weep at Eleanor Atkinson’s novel <em>Greyfriars Bobby</em>.
