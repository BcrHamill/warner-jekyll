    These Demented Lands (questions contributed by Alan McMunnigall)
</p>
<p>
    In <em>These Demented Lands</em>, the character of Morvern returns. What were your artistic motivations in working with the same character over your first
    two books?
</p>
<p>
    I don’t want to sound mercenary or anti-intellectual, but I’m not too sure about artistic motivations in relation to Morvern being in the first two books.
    And I don’t want to sound like a fake Zen guru either, but you can only do what you can do in the moment. It’s really more a case of chance and what came
    out the mix – and all the chaos back then.
</p>
<p>
    I remember that when I wrote the manuscript of <em>Morvern Callar</em> in 1992-3, I had zero presumption it would get published. That seemed totally
    rational to me; new writers today are so wired in about getting published and agents and all that stuff; there are all these creative writing scenarios -
    which is a good thing - but I had no clue about it in my day, though I was of course, quite curious and not without a vague ambition. I got the addresses
    of publishers from the front of the books I liked. But the whole concept of <em>Morvern Callar</em> was that it was bound to be a rejected manuscript - a
    sort of nasty, ironic message in a bottle which would be bobbing about, unwanted forever. That was the intent in writing it. An absurd stance - but that’s
    honestly how I imagined things would go. Then circumstances changed rapidly when I fell in amongst other writers, like Duncan McLean. He told me not to be
    such a precious idiot and just to send the manuscript off to some publishers. I sent it out to several – it’s not often mentioned, but two well-known
    Scottish publishers turned <em>Morvern Callar</em> down on the spot. Very quickly it was accepted for publication at Jonathan Cape by the editor Robin
    Robertson - who had published <em>Trainspotting</em>. As soon as <em>Morvern Callar</em> was accepted grand schemes started to percolate under the
    influence of my latest tipple: brandy and Perrier I think it was then. The way <em>These Demented Lands</em> came about is that it was originally intended
    as forming part of a quartet or cycle of novels. When I say “intended,” I mean I dreamed this up while staring out some window or sitting in the corner of
some pub. I should also mention that Duncan McLean and I had talked about his own planned-but-never-to-be, trilogy of novels, after his first novel    <em>Blackden</em> was published He was going to write this great-sounding novel called <em>Jaw Bone Walk</em>, then another. Understandably, I knew no
    publisher would ever agree to such a multi-book deal with an unknown new writer like me – even though Morvern quickly became quite a ‘successful’ novel in
    publishing terms. This was just something I told myself I was going to do to get myself under steam. I do clearly recall experiencing a belief that I was
    in a position to write whatever I wanted after Morvern’s reception into the bosom of the world, and as Morvern sold more and more, including film rights, I
    knew I didn’t have to play it safe. I was just puzzling out exactly <em>what</em> to write next. I remember that as usual I was broke – not destitute, but
    broke – when I should have been working on a new novel in the summer of 1996, I worked instead with Boilerhouse Theatre Company on an adaptation of
    Buchner’s <em>Lenz</em>. That show toured Scotland under the title: <em>No New Miracles</em>, with the late Peter Grimes - a lovely guy, who I can’t
    believe is gone so young- in the lead role. I was far from happy with the production – there were certainly no new miracles therein, which is not to place
    blame elsewhere –all its failings were my failings as its writer. This was quite a mad period for me, with attendant Keith Moon-inspired book touring; the
    idea of a linked novel sequence must just have given me some type of structure, the hope of continuity and a long term direction at that time. As a reader,
    I love novel sequences. Reading is a narcotic and I am an addict, so I adore the indulgence of the old roman-fleuve: Duncan McLean and I were of course,
very enamoured by <em>A Scots Quair</em> but I was also nuts about Moorcock’s linked <em>Cornelius Chronicles</em>, Dorothy Richardson’s    <em> Pilgrimage</em>, Sartre’s <em>Roads to Freedom</em>, Nan Shepherd’s <em>Grampian Quartet</em>, Madox Ford’s Tietjens sequence, the Beckett trilogy and
    so on. So to the best of my recall, in my own daft wee scheme of things, the mighty “Morvern Cycle” was going to be <em>Morvern Callar</em>, then there was
    going to be a novel where Morvern was a single mum working part-time in an old people’s home during a Highland winter, then there was going to be the
    apparently unconnected “novel” from <em>Morvern Callar</em> - which Morvern’s boyfriend had written and Morvern had falsely published under her own name.
    Then there was going to be an oneiric novel, where the pregnant Morvern dreamed or hallucinated that she had died and entered a Hell-like
    circus-dreamscape, fearing for the welfare of her unborn child. That was <em>These Demented Lands</em>. So much for all these great notions, eh? After
    writing Demented, I started straight in on what was to become <em>The Sopranos</em> and the whole novel-cycle concept sort of evaporated and got left
    behind, though it has come back to life with <em>The Sopranos</em> and <em>The Stars in the Bright Sky</em> - and <em>The Deadman’s Pedal</em> which I see
    as part of an ongoing cycle. Around that time in the early 90s I was also writing fragments of a strange novel set in the Highlands amongst a millenarian
    Christian sect of young people who have been infiltrated by drugs and a nasty, sexually exploitative guru. This was similarly abandoned - and doubtless for
    the better - though I occasionally toy with the idea of going back to it. I do feel its spirit influenced <em>These Demented Lands</em>. It was sometimes
    titled <em>Trend Fault Team 2</em>, sometimes <em>The Far Places.</em>
</p>
<p>
    Do you regard <em>These Demented Lands</em> as in any way a sequel to Morvern Callar?
</p>
<p>
    <em>These Demented Lands </em>
    seemed to me more like a parallel text - an adjunct to her uneasy unconscious, a fever dream which Morvern was having. It would have been easier for me to
    have written a straight Morvern Part 2, but I just didn’t want to do that. Or not in a realistic style with the quotidian details of her pregnancy. I was
    really amazed when <em>These Demented Lands</em> was sometimes reviewed as a piece of realism. I mean, it seemed to me the novel was about people trying to
    track down pieces of a crashed UFO which have been buried in a coffin – it certainly wasn’t “gritty” social realism. I think some critics came with a
    strong cultural stereotype about what Scottish writing at that time was presumed to be – a stereotype I was immediately kicking against - though I
    shouldn’t sound nasty, because from what I recall, the book was very well reviewed - just misunderstood.
</p>
<p>
    One thing I do clearly recall is that when I started writing <em>These Demented Lands </em>its structure was very different. It initially centred on a
    mixed group of folk in a pub on an inner hebridean island, who talk about novels over pints and drinks; they weren’t as formal as a Book Group, just a
    disparate collective of four of five people who meet in the pub and informally talk books. The way I used to. But sections of a strange manuscript were
    being mysteriously posted to the address of this pub – a larger manuscript was building up for this increasingly motivated reading group, a manuscript
    which referred to a selection of very local myths and apocryphal tales and even referred to the origins of local, freakish landmarks. I was assembling this
    weird geography of a strange island. I definitely recall that I was thinking of both (for some reason) Hesse’s <em>The Glass Bead Game</em> and (more
    understandably) Brian Friel’s play, <em>Translations</em>. These characters in the pub were analysing the sections of text as they came in, while at the
    same time they were trying to work out what was happening in the texts – if these events had indeed occurred in the past or if they were going to happen in
    the future – was it all fact or fiction? So that novel was quite a curious, strange bit of writing but naturally, very talky. I seem to have lost the draft
    manuscript of this original opening in a great biblical flood which in 2006 really did destroy a lot of my books and documents in the cellar, coating them
    in a glorious slime of river mud. I was trying to find that manuscript for the National Library of Scotland, but could not, so I can’t remember now how
    many physical pages I wrote in this mode. Not that much, sixty to ninety pages, at a guess. But I soon thought the stand-alone texts being sent in to the
    pub, which constitute what you read today, were more compelling and I abandoned that meta-fictional framing mode. There were too many characters building
    up in that version, so I was doubtful it was working. Ironic that I got involved with a novel like <em>The Sopranos</em> next, which has loads of
    characters.
</p>
<p>
    Some readers were struck by apparent differences in the characterisation of Morvern over the two novels. Did you set out to show a different perspective of
    Morvern in <em>These Demented Lands</em>?
</p>
<p>
    Well I wanted her to seem a little more jaded, perhaps cynical and also, as if she has herself has become a curious reader of fictional narratives after
    her own ersatz publication. She seems aware of textual matters, like punctuation and phrasing, which she comments on. But of course, in a dream we conceive
    of ourselves in different ways. It is strange looking back on your writing after all this time - of course no novelist can give a perfect list of the books
    that they intend to write - and then fulfil that list. Balzac tried. Things change along the way. It is sort of a wonderful or maybe frightening adventure:
    at the end of the day, what will you have come up with, as opposed to what your intentions were as a writer back in the beginning?
</p>
<p>
    The novel features allegory, symbolism, strong imagery, highly descriptive prose and has an overall surreal quality that at times feels like fantasy. Were
    you consciously writing against/ reacting to a ‘realist’ tradition?
</p>
<p>
    You are right. Without doubt that is exactly what I was doing. It is a pretty bonkers novel. I quite consciously wanted to push against “realism” as a mode
    of writing for this particular novel and to move into a far more gothic, mythical, surreal style – almost mocking ‘traditional Scottish realist’ subject
    matter and subverting it with a crazy, dream-like plot. But then I was happy to move back into realism within the text and also in my later novels. I do
    love realism and all the questions that it throws up. You go right back to Flaubert’s Bovary and you realise how much poetry is in him. He wanted to be
    romantic, but couldn’t in that novel, compared to say the beautiful <em>Saint Julian the Hospitator</em> – honesty made Flaubert destroy the romantic in
    Bovary, and you can bring realism right up through Zola and Joyce, through Kelman to some of the contemporary American short story writers, like Annie
    Proulx or Barry Hannah, Junot Diaz. I think it’s the most challenging mode to write in, the most rewarding one to read, but of course I enjoy lots of
    different styles: I am a fan of quite a lot of science fiction and of course I am fascinated by historical novels too. In a way all novels are historical
    novels.
</p>
<p>
    Some critics have described <em>These Demented Lands</em> as ‘an apocalyptic’ work. Would you agree?
</p>
<p>
    I think that’s fair enough. I don’t know if everything I write doesn’t have apocalyptic potential! With <em>These Demented Lands</em>, I do remember I was
    also thinking in terms of McCarthy’s <em>Blood Meridian</em> and Miguel Asturias – his novel <em>The President</em>. Both of which seem fairly apocalyptic
    in tone. I am not saying for a moment that my junk compares to those stellar things (and neither does much from my contemporaries, I might add) – just the
    thrills those books give you are starting points. You don’t want to emulate the books you admire, you want to approximate the emotions they engender. I
    seemed to find back in those days that if I started off with the “feel” of another few books in my mind, I soon got something down on the page which felt
    like my own. By the way, talking of this novel, there’s this band called Maximo Park with a great sad-voiced singer, Paul, and I am a bit star struck
    because they’ve just done this great song about <em>These Demented Lands</em>, called ‘Leave This Island.’ It’s really gorgeous. It’ll do for my funeral!
</p>
<p>
    How important is the island setting to the structure of the work?
</p>
<p>
    Well setting is geography, and geography is always so very important in any novel – think about the endless wonder which is <em>Wuthering Heights</em>, its
    highly localized, repeating geography and how it functions. But there needs to be a large justification in cases where the setting almost becomes the
    story, and that can happen. For instance, two writers who perfectly justify an obsession with specific local geographies are Georgio Bassani and Patrick
    Modiano –or as much Modiano as I have been able guzzle up in English translation. Now that he’s won the Nobel, I hope there will be far more of his work in
    English. For these two great writers, a specific urban geography is deeply significant to their work: in Modiano’s <em>Dora Bruder,</em> the highly
    detailed, specific streets and addresses of Paris become in themselves a framework, a Dante-like map of life and death, as they actually were during the
    Nazi occupation. These were fatal geographies - for some. Most of these same streets, addresses and apartments are perfectly preserved in Paris today and
    still hold a massive, horrific historical relevance for Modiano, which he works through in <em>Dora Bruder</em>; he becomes a cartographer of catastrophe.
    With Bassani, the very specific walled geography of Ferrara and its environs is as much part of his painstaking - and heart-breaking - evocation of a time
    and place as is the characterization of those young people; the way they are thoughtlessly and naturally integrated into this geography from which the
    Jewish members will so soon be forcibly deported. It’s a similarly doomed and menacing world for its Jewish population as is Modiano’s Paris. Bassani is
    building both a beautiful, faultless portrait of a time and place, but also a rigorous testimony.
</p>
<p>
    You can see why the geographical observation is so acute in these two writers. I think novelists and story tellers adore a small island setting because it
    immediately and conveniently demarcates the limits of the geography; it sets up the simple notion of the drama – either characters want off the island, or
    something is coming there. Though ironically, is all “British-set” fiction, not also set on an island? But think of all the great novels set on wee
    islands: Defoe, Capek, Verne and of course Robert Louis Stevenson. The setting of my novel, the landscape this dream is based upon, is the Isle of Mull.
    That epigraph to <em>These Demented Lands</em>: ‘We went down into the waste…’ comes from a description of Rannoch Moor in <em>Kidnapped</em> and in the
    same novel, Alan Breck and David Balfour also cross the actual landscape of Mull, in that remarkable orography of their journey, into and through history
    and then out of it again to something more moving and personal. On the other hand, if you think of <em>Treasure Island</em>, the story seems to have
    literally grown out of a map of an imaginary island which Stevenson drew with his young stepson. Yet when you read the text closely, you see that the
    microcosm of the map sometimes becomes a little vague in the macrocosm of the actual story. That’s what I find anyway. The locations have come first, not
    the story. This interplay with geography is very interesting, I mean Stevenson’s impulse seems to be his need to be faithful to a specific geography, and
    this happens again and again in his work. But his faithfulness to the map, kind of trips him up! It’s always like this as a fiction writer when you get
    tied down. I remember deliberately keeping the geography malleable in <em>These Demented Lands</em>, so I could get my characters about easily. That’s
    always the basic problem of rural settings for novels, if characters don’t have cars, how do you get them about? They are always waiting for trains or
    buses, or cadging lifts. Even in a dreamscape! So the setting is based on Mull where my mother’s family are from and I spend time there, but of course it
    is a Mull in a troubled dream, an imagined place, melted by the strange opiate of sleep into something else.

    Morvern Callar (questions contributed by Brian Dunsmore)
</p>
<p>
    If you had to go back now and make one change to <em>Morvern Callar</em>, what would it be and why? What would be your own biggest criticism of the novel?
</p>
<p>
    I don’t want to seem as if I am in any way overly satisfied or smug about any of my novels, but I wouldn’t change anything in artistic terms. It always
    strikes me that a painter would never try to repaint a canvas, or a band wouldn’t overdub and edit on top of an earlier album, so it bothers me when you
    hear about novelists “revising” their work for a new edition or collected volume or whatever. Poets and composers do it too. I absolutely understand there
    are always small typos or misplaced commas that pray on the neurotic writer’s mind and deep in the night, many a comma has brought beads of sweat to my own
    brow. I understand that writers feel their “style” changing, that they would not form sentences or use metaphors in the same way today that they might have
    thirty years previously. They want to unify things. But I am saddened and feel mildly swindled when I learn that a book you thought was written in – say –
    1934, was actually quite substantially tampered with and revised by its author in 1964, with large bits of it cut out or many sentences reformed and other
    things added. I utterly identify with the writer’s temptation to do this, but I disagree with the act. It seems to me like a sour breach of the space-time
    continuum. I also believe a certain vanity lies behind the act, the a-historic impulse to literally re-write the past and ‘improve’ yourself. I find old
    Waugh a snobbish, cold, cruel writer, but it would be churlish to deny his work can sometimes be memorable and impressively written. If you look at an
    early edition of <em>Brideshead Revisited </em>from the 1940s, it is a slightly different text from later editions which he rewrote. Waugh claimed he was
    so obsessed with food - due to the wartime rationing – at the time of writing, that he over-stuffed the book with descriptions of eating. But he made other
    changes too.
</p>
<p>
    Not to try and wriggle away from your question though, I honestly don’t know what my biggest criticism of <em>Morvern Callar</em> would be. I tried to make
    it as good as I could at the time, as I do with all my stuff. A change I would make is one I have been failing to make for twenty years. Take a look at the
    book. The epigraph comes before the Acknowledgements – a basic typesetting error. I have laboured in vain to get them switched around whenever there is a
    reprint, but your publishers don’t tell you when they intend to print up more and I continually miss the bus. When they did a movie tie-in edition of
    Morvern I did manage to get the epigraph and acknowledgements swapped round but guess what? When the next editions came out – the ones with the sort of
    rose gold covers – the bloody thing had changed back again! I remember jumping up and down on the spot screaming when I saw that – the perfect image of a
    non-revising author. I am not saying the book is faultless at all, but that’s the thing that bugs me most after twenty years.
</p>
<p>
    Do you have any regrets about, or were there any pitfalls to, receiving such acclaim so early in your writing career?
</p>
<p>
    I suppose we have to try and be precise and careful about what we mean by ‘acclaim,’ but I get the general idea. I suppose in our world and its media, the
    choice a no brainer. Would you want your first novel to be politely acknowledged or would you want it to make a bigger ‘splash,’ and I suppose Morvern,
    without going too large, leaned more to the splash variety. I do recognize an immediate result of this for me and it is far more subjective than you would
    expect: you think to yourself, ‘I produced an absolute child of my imagination here, and somehow it has reverberated and been acknowledged in the outer
    world.’ This establishes the presumption of a weird two-way conduit between your private imaginings and the often vulgar concreteness of the world. It
    really encourages you to keep on doing this, to free up your imagination and let your fancy take you where it may, as a writer. If there are pitfalls, it’s
    that the crunch probably comes years after the fact. I am still writing absolutely what I want to write, birthing the obscure creatures of my imagination
    onto the page, like that recent novel, <em>The Deadman’s Pedal</em> – a novel about guys driving trains in the Highlands of the 1970s. You do think to
    yourself: ‘Oh man, who would actually want to read this stuff - other than me?’ But amazingly, I know that people actually <em>do</em> like to read and
    even love that novel - and others of mine too, these sort of private dreams of mine which have been given exposure. That’s a remarkable thing. I have met
    many readers at book events; sometimes they write to me and without trying to sound crass, it is very moving for me to learn that readers can react - often
    so profoundly - to my private inner imaginings and indulgences. I don’t want to sound a crawler, but I am ever so grateful to those readers, especially the
    ones who have bothered to express their thoughts on-line, or even to write me a letter. Believe me that you can feel horribly self-indulgent, like a
    megalomaniac, as a novel writer. And the book world is one of megalomaniacs. But it is true enough as Keats wrote to Shelly, it’s the monastery of the
    imagination and you are its monk. Having ‘acclaim’ for a first novel like <em>Morvern Callar</em> sort of marries you to your own imagination very early
    on, in a very solid way. You feel that you are working as a servant of your imagination, not a readership or a publisher. You think: ‘Well that came from
    in there, from inside my daft brain box, so everything else can too!’ Now that might not always be the case. As the years go by, your work might not appeal
    at all to the readers who once did like it, but so it goes; half the fun is letting your imagination go where it wants.
</p>
<p>
    You are probably thinking that I am automatically taking the stance here of a noble, puritanical and upright aesthete, sticking fast and faithfully to my
    imaginative guns and decrying such crass manoeuvres as say, genre writing – but I am not. In fact I believe I am being slowly corrupted, because to me it
    is now interesting to think: ‘Well, what would I write like, if instead of pleasing myself and writing about Highland train drivers, or schoolgirls on the
    rampage – what if I tried to write what I thought people seem to want to read these days, according to the best seller lists – say a psychological
    thriller? Or a zombie novel! To me - a writer who has always followed the paths of what takes his fancy - that’s quite a revolutionary and exciting
    thought. But I have so many other books in my head, clambering around trying to get out, I don’t see me finding time to do anything else.
</p>
<p>
    One thing I remember clearly is that after <em>Morvern Callar</em> was published I recognised I had a sort of choice. I think sometimes, faced with that
    sort of ‘acclaim’ in any art form, you can decide to get all precious and self-important, you seize up and hide away for six or seven years to create your
    astonishing Next Masterpiece. I do recall rapping myself on the knuckles and making a definite decision to plunge right in and forge ahead with another
    couple of books. I kind of sensed I might freeze with stage fright otherwise. You sometimes get that with rock bands don’t you? Their debut is so acclaimed
    it sort of freezes them into a difficult second album complex, they become terrifies that their next work might not meet the acclaim of the first and they
    often never make another good record, or take far too long to do it – I was a bit scared of that happening to me and elected to plunge straight back in
    with <em>These Demented Lands</em>. On the other hand, this might just have been because I had found there was nothing else in life I could do to make a
    living – I am useless at everything else. Suddenly I discovered, to my shock, that I could write a book. Now, twenty years on, I am totally locked in to
    this writing life and it seems there is nothing else I can do?
</p>
<p>
    With the experience and success you have now as a writer, what advice would you give yourself then - before, during and after - writing your first novel?
</p>
<p>
    “Success” is a very slippery concept in the book world, and being asked for advice is like a doctor self-medicating! Obviously the advice I would give my
    own idiotic self is very different from what I would recommend to other people. I suppose, before, writing my first novel - without trying to make out I am
    any big shakes - I would say to myself: have just a wee bit more confidence that your writing has some redeeming quality. Because honestly, I can’t tell
    you how little confidence I had as I laboured away on <em>Morvern Callar</em> over long hours. And it still feels like that with each new novel I write.
    That’s what happens, you have to work so intensely on something you just can’t see it clearly anymore; you drift offshore and lose sight of it. There
    again, experience has also taught me that having too much confidence can be an awful thing for writers to have. I have met writers who carry their
    confidence around with them like a mighty catheter bag, gurgling away down their trouser leg (or under their skirt).
</p>
<p>
    During the writing of Morvern I would have told myself – if I could have financially afforded it - to go for the luxury of hiring a professional typist to
    do the so-called final draft manuscript, rather than doing it myself. This was in 1993, in the days of the dinosaurs, before computers and printers. I
    think the first quarter of that manuscript was single-finger-typed with a manual typewriter which rendered capital J’s and B’s half in black ink, half in
    red, because of the weird mixed ribbon I used. The second half was completed with a bad electric typewriter where the “e” appeared higher than any other
    letters. And worse, every page was comprehensively caked in a palimpsest of Tippex correcting fluid and then swathes and splashings of Milk of Magnesia: I
    had discovered several layers of the Milk of Magnesia worked quite well as a cheap substitute for Tippex. Sometimes there was no way you could re-type over
    a section of the Tippex-encrusted paper, which would audibly snap if you bent the page over the typewriter roller - so I had to type the word separately on
    another blank sheet, cut out the little rectangle of paper and affix the word in to the manuscript page using clear Sellotape. It was more a work of
    sculpture than Fiction.
</p>
<p>
    After? Don’t turn up to every media interview already drunk.
</p>
<p>
    Was there anyone in your personal life that inspired a particular character or character name in the book?
</p>
<p>
    I am not trying to be evasive but I don’t really think so. You know it’s a weird thing. There are contemporaries and relatives of mine who come from Oban,
the same town I am from, which is basically the town I used as a jumping off point for my own fictional setting of The Port, and in reading    <em>Morvern Callar</em> those people will just not recognise it as our town. You know, I have heard this from someone in the town: “Warner, where did you
    get all that stuff from?” Yet at the same time, people have said, “You got all that spot on pal, it was just like that wasn’t it”? I suppose it’s to do
    with life experience but also a lot to do with subjectivity. I was reading all that Sartre stuff intensely back then, <em>What is Literature</em> and is it
    called: What is Existentialism? I was always struck by Sartre’s concepts of subjectivity, which I think came out of Heidegger. Sartre said quite clearly
    that nothing gets beyond subjectivity. I would now question aspects about that, but it’s amazing how, for instance, people see the same events, locations
    or historical periods very differently in retrospective. Look at witnesses to crimes, or battlefield descriptions. I was looking one way and some of my
    mates were looking the other way. All these great conundrums come up with ideas of realism in fiction. You might start out with a detail that is based on
    someone you knew or saw in a small community like the one I came from, but then you plaster on a few more things that come from other people, then you
    change something else and it is no longer a portrait of anyone distinct. It’s become fiction. I mean, there might be anecdotes that happened to people in
    that novel, but they are all mixed up into differing times and places and rearranged and changed. I have forgotten the sources of a lot of the anecdotes.
    Very few things in that book happened to me, some things happened to other people, lots of other people and a lot of things are made up. I understand why
    people ask that question about it being based on or a portrait of real individuals. I am not superior to that question myself. I want to know, in the most
vulgar way, how much of Cornelius Suttree is Cormac McCarthy, or how much of Adolphe is Benjamin Constant, but none one of my novels, including    <em>Morvern Callar,</em> is what I believe is called a roman a clef, when you basically write autobiography and just change the names. It always strikes me
    as interesting that crime writers are never asked if they have actually murdered someone! In fact the distance between my life and my fiction again sets up
    the temptation of really writing an absolute Kerouac-like roman a clef, based on my actual life, or a period in my life, as it’s something I have never
    tried.
</p>
<p>
    You asked about names. Say you take that sequence when Morvern relates the nick names of all the characters that are in the Mantrap club or disco. Those
    nick names serve an obvious narrative purpose to my mind – they make the social setting come alive in a small way, and those names tell us stories about
    the social environment. I love apt nick names and it’s true the place where I grew up abounded in them. I guess everywhere does, but on the west coast a
    lot of people share the same surnames, so there are lots of very inventive nick names flying about. Most of those ones in Morvern are just made up, some
    are nicknames maybe I heard in Inverness and Edinburgh or in Mallaig, where my sister lived then, maybe one or two did actually exist but they might have
    been private nick names, that just me and my mates applied to certain individuals. I know I deliberately did <em>not</em> use a few nicknames I wanted to,
    as they were still definite figures about town or would have been remembered. I just thought up a nickname the other day that I am going to use in the
    sequel to <em>The Deadman’s Pedal</em>, this guy is going to be called The Detonator!
</p>
<p>
    Almost twenty years on, what do you think has become of Morvern herself?
</p>
<p>
    Probably married a Russian arms dealer? That’s the wonderful thing about art forms though. The characters are forever trapped in the amber of their time
    and setting - in paintings and in movies too. Heathcliff is forever grumping on the moors, Don Quixote is always riding out, across the horizon – every day
    – and they always will be for us, as long as we still open these books. For me – in her modest way – Morvern is forever moving through the bright shadows
    of that Spanish orchard, in the last days of her happiness and youth.
</p>
<p>
    Were you unhappy with any of the changes that were made in the film adaptation?
</p>
<p>
    When Lynne Ramsay got on board I recall clearly saying to her that she should do whatever she wanted to, but that’s like telling a ball to roll downhill.
    Filmmakers will do what they want. When you sell the film rights to your book you pass it over to the people from the Silver Screen – god help you. But
    Lynne was brilliant, very lovely, very open, no film-biz bullshit, nobody’s fool. She’s from Maryhill. She sent me all the screenplays as she worked on
them. She’s a maverick like me, and I do think Lynne is a genius film maker. I really mean that - a genius. Did you see    <em>We Need to Talk About Kevin</em>? Wonderful, it was like a tone poem that film. I think she and Andrea Arnold are the two giant poets of British film
    just now. Interesting the two best filmmakers are women – and a good thing too. What are other folk doing? I mean really? You look at Andrea and Lynne’s
    stuff and you see so many directors are just making junk. And bad junk, not even good junk. I have wide tastes - for instance I admire Neil Marshall’s
    films very much. He makes completely different films from Lynne and Andrea, ones that people might try to label junk, but I love them. Neil is totally
    unfashionable but a brilliant, individual filmmaker. He seems to operate a bit outside of the golden circles of British film as well.
</p>
<p>
    One thing that I hope does not sound condescending about the film of <em>Morvern Callar, </em>I mean it very sincerely, is that it was a film made by
    women: the director, the co-writer, Liana Dognini, (who tragically, has since passed away) the two main actresses: Sam and Kathleen, Andrea Calderwood as a
    producer, the line producer Robyn Slovo (she is Joe Slovo’s daughter). I trusted them all with the film in a way I wouldn’t have trusted a bunch of leery
    blokes, like me. Doesn’t mean they didn’t do my nut in now and again, and I know I could drive them mad too - I can be a pain in the arse and difficult
    about odd little things, but obviously it was a book about young women. I felt that Lynne and company would do the right thing. And they did – that
    nightclub shot at the end still sends shivers down my spine just thinking about it.
</p>
<p>
    The problem with <em>Morvern Callar</em> right from the start of its film development, was that it’s one of those novels which might seduce the reader
    through character, imagery and atmosphere but it was impossibly tricky to adapt fro cinema. If you don’t use voice-over - and Lynne refused to use
    voice-over, right from the start of her script writing - you are straight in to a film of images, textures, music and sparse dialogue without that voice of
    Morvern chipping away at you, which the reader has in the book. So much goes on in that damn novel; it is very condensed: treks out into the countryside,
    train journeys to-and-fro, (in one, a pre-figuring of <em>The Deadman’s Pedal</em>, Morvern travels up on the engine!), camping trips, Morvern flies to
    Spain not once but twice, then comes back again twice. How do you show all that stuff cinematically without characters who constantly talk? And here is a
    lead character who by definition doesn’t say much, in the days just before everyone had a mobile phone. It was impossibly difficult and we all knew it
    would have to change a lot
</p>
<p>
    I have to admit, Lynne’s film of <em>Morvern Callar</em> is pretty much a “film-on-the themes-of-<em>Morvern Callar,</em>” rather than a very pious and
    faithful adaptation of the novel. But I would sooner have this film than some strident pop video with a corny voice over. Look at Andrea Arnold’s amazing
    adaptation of <em>Wuthering Heights</em>. Half the novel is missed out, but that film is still a ravishing, emotionally flooring experience. Once Lynne was
    doing Morvern without voice-over, it was inevitably going to go somewhere new. That’s what Lynne does, she is too much of an auteur just to do an
    adaptation, it will become something Ramsay-esque. I’ve watched her work and she is after this essence of truth, of verity in every shot. So she shoots a
    take again and again and it seems to me, it is sort of when all the theatricality, all the filmic drama is OUT of the shot, when it seems like undiluted
    reality, that’s the take Lynne uses - the one when it seems totally authentic. It’s a really difficult way to work, difficult for her I mean, but that’s
    how she does it. Right now I hear she is doing an adaptation of <em>Moby Dick </em>set in outer space. That’s genius. It takes someone from Maryhill to
    make that! I loved that film of Morvern and it was great fun going up to Oban when they were making it, staying with Sam Morton - who was a whole load of
    fun - at the Isle of Eriska Hotel, where I emptied the wine cellar. I always say this. If I saw that <em>Morvern Callar</em> movie when I was 21 years of
    age, I would have had a heart attack in the cinema. That is the film I dreamed of seeing when I was 21. And I’d have gone out and bought the book. It was a
    French art movie, made in Oban! To think that this somehow came about is still thrilling and it was a long bloody road to get that film made, from the
first interest down to my wife and I at the Cannes film festival, drunk. One thing I wanted to say is that the first person to try to make    <em>Morvern Callar </em>into a film was this very nice fellow from Glasgow named Ian Madden, a writer and assistant director. Ian was the first on the band
    wagon before anyone else, but what happened was, the novel got bigger and bigger and Ian sort of got steamrollered over which was very tough on him – he
    had only been able to pay a very small advance for a limited option period and suddenly I was getting these pretty big offers in from Channel 4 and BBC and
    all that, which put me in an awkward position, but Ian was the original person to get in there and try to make a film out of the novel and he deserves
    acknowledgment. I thought he might be able to keep involved but as I already suspected, the film world can be a tough one, with few angels – or the angels
    that are in it, tend to have broken wings. I recall strolling around with Ian Madden in Glasgow one sunny day, talking about the adaptation of Morvern,
    then this guy on a big silver Harley, all in black leathers, pulls over, It’s Bill Forsyth who knew Ian. I was well struck by the glamour of
    Hollywood-on-Clyde. In about 1998, the brilliant American writer Mark Richard – who <em>These Demented Lands </em>is dedicated to, wanted me to come out to
    live in Hollywood where he was working, but I didn’t really believe it was my scene. I prefer Benidorm.

<p>
    The Sopranos (questions contributed by Lewis Gordon)
</p>
<p>
    The narrator in <em>The </em><em>Sopranos</em> is incredibly fluid - from sentence to sentence fleeting through linguistic registers, and colluding with
    various characters. Did you find this voice instinctively or was it a challenge to smooth over the joins?
</p>
<p>
    I remember having various impressions about the narrator. Firstly, I believed the narrator was a younger woman from the same culture as the girls, but
    older than them - in her late 20s, early 30s maybe. The second thing was, I felt she had studied philosophy then suddenly become disgusted with it. As it
    seems Finn later will. I also felt she sort of disapproved of the girls at the start of the novel, but gradually came to be on their side, as if the
    narrative voice was won over by the girls. A slow arc of approval developed.
</p>
<p>
    Many people still just assume that the narrative voice is the voice of the author. A lot of the time it is. You might assume that in say Greene, Kerouac –
    maybe – but it is probably more complex than that. I feel if you give your narrator certain attitudes, even very small, subtle things which are at a
    tangent, it’s remarkable how it colours the whole narrative. I mean you can take it to an absurd degree. You could say, Okay, the narrative voice is mine
    BUT, I will pretend I am phobic about the colour blue. Then in your novel you would have all these odd, heightened descriptions of the sky and of the sea,
    or a character’s eyes and it would give this odd resonance to the narrative
</p>
<p>
    2.
</p>
<p>
    How do music references find their way into your writing? In <em>The </em><em>Sopranos</em> there are some great moments with Kylah's musical obsessions
    and <em>He Loved Him Madly</em> is a perfect soundtrack to <em>Morvern Callar</em>. Do you listen to music as you work?
</p>
<p>
    I guess I am a bit of an obsessional music lover, so I have to take care with my obsession. If music is mentioned in the text I try not to let it overwhelm
    a narrative. If you mention music, it must serve some sort of function within the story. In Morvern, I thought the careful music lists reflected her
    methodical, practical disposition, the same way she obsessively details exactly what she eats, what sexual positions she adopts, how often she lights a
    cigarette and how she coordinates the disposal of her dead boyfriend’s dismembered corpse. I liked the sort of prosaic, methodical menace she exuded and in
    a way this justified her precision over the music lists.
</p>
<p>
    In <em>The Worms Can Carry Me to Heaven</em>, there was no mention of music at all; Manolo was a character I deliberately gave the trait that he doesn’t
    like music, though I recall, me-being-me, there was a long chapter trying to explain why he didn’t like music, where he described going to an orchestral
    concert in Madrid and hating it. I edited the chapter out because of course, I was just using it as an excuse to write about music in a book not meant to
    have anything about music in it.
</p>
<p>
    I am cautious and insufferably fussy about listening to music while I am working. I use CDs playing in my study to tempt myself to the desk, then I let
    them run out and try not to put a new one on. I have the the usual, oft-quoted reason for not writing with music playing while I write – or more
    accurately, try to write - which I know other writers experience. You think it is your wonderful writing that is dynamic, or emotionally moving on the
    page, but it’s actually the music that gives your dead prose a lift. You read back your moving sequence and it doesn’t work at all; you recognise it was
    the music which made you feel those things behind the writing. Music allows you to fool yourself better.
</p>
<p>
    Sometimes as I write I do have electronic music on, or very thinned out music with no beat. Something that I can’t actually listen closely to and which
    must be monotonous. Some of Brian Eno’s music is great for that. Even when I was a student in 1984 I used to listen to his ‘Discreet Music’ and ‘On Land,’
    late at night when my girlfriend was sleeping. ‘Neroli’ and I think it’s called, ‘Thursday Afternoon’ are great. These are pieces Eno made especially for
    CD and about 70 mins long, so you don’t have to get up every 35 minutes and push the CD play switch again - so that keeps my ass sat at the desk - which is
    where you want it to be, not circling the room like a water-diviner as I usually am, polishing the picture frames and staring out the window.
</p>
<p>
    Eno’s a bit of a wonder isn’t he? I loved his music from when I was 15 years old and we bought this vinyl double album: <em>Here Come the Warm Jets</em>
    and <em>Before and After Science, </em>stuck together as a double album for the price of one. You listen to all the stuff Eno did, from Roxy through the
    early 70s and he broke so many barriers, established so many things far ahead of his contemporaries. More-or less, you hear all of New Wave music in Eno’s
    first three albums, between 1973 and 75. Anyway, his electronic music is good to write to. Or maybe ‘Great Expectations,’ this track by Miles Davis which
    is again a long track, very monotonous and very influential – Bill Laswell is cool, a great live bass player, but Bill must have made ten whole albums just
    based on ‘Great Expectations’! I also have this rare recording, <em>Chitinous</em> by a genius English composer called Paul Buckmaster and his girlfriend
    Diana Lewis, which is good to listen to for writing – it’s these sort of repeating cycles; he is a talented arranger who used to work with Leonard Cohen
    and Elton John but he is really far out. I can also write to Messiaen’s thing: ‘Quartet for the End of Time,’ or I can have something by Stockhausen or his
    sons in the background that isn’t too abrasive. Music you can give your attention to if you wish but you can also ignore. All of this is just to give some
    atmosphere to my study, because the sound of the study’s demanding silence can be a bit intimidating, especially first thing in the day. I could never
    listen to the radio – even good old Off the Ball or something like that while working, this would be impossible for a drama queen like me.
</p>
<p>
    3. There is a cryptic reference to "the St. Tequila's Convent Girls" in the acknowledgements at the end of the book. Did you do any particular research
    into writing the female dialogue - which forms a huge part of the story - or just write from your own gut, memories and experience?
</p>
<p>
    Being honest, your phrase, ‘gut, memories and experience’ just perfectly sums it up. I mean I can give you some background to the genesis of the book. That
    was when I was living in Ireland which I did for many, many years and the St Tequila thing is a reference to my wife, Hollie-Lisa and her mates. Hollie at
    the time, was about 19 and you know, we were running wild around Dublin and Wicklow. Tequila shots were often involved. Hollie and her mates attended an
    all-girl state convent school in Ireland – and they had mostly just left the school or were even still in it or going up to college or Uni or had jobs in
    the small town we lived near. There had been a school choir and they would tell me all these stories about it, so it was from hanging out with them I got
    the idea. I mean <em>The Sopranos</em> shows how completely fictional my work is. It’s a simple fact that while Oban is a starting point for my fiction,
    there is no way that novel could possibly be set in a realistic Oban. The simple fact is that the Catholic population in Oban is far too small to support a
    large school that - never mind boys - only contains Catholic girls. There did used to be a small Catholic High School in Oban in the 70s, but it was
    completely amalgamated into the local comprehensive. There was a convent in town where you could see the nuns in their white habits moving mysteriously
    around their garden. And when I was a little boy in 1969, a submarine did come to anchor in Oban bay and members of the public could go out to visit it.
    That section I seem to recall in the novel, comparing the submarine to Jonah’s whale is there because I was so young someone teased me - maybe my sister -
    that it wasn’t a submarine, it was a whale, and when my father and I went out in the launch to board the submarine I became very afraid that it was indeed
    a whale and I would have to go inside it. I recall all that quite clearly and I remember the pink ambient light inside the thing, like a huge alimentary
    canal. I thought it was horrible and oppressive. Even at 4 years old, I realized Trident was a load of bad, expensive bullshit!
</p>
<p>
    I am also very interested in the idea of holy shrines, pilgrimage sites and the commercial exploitation of them which what you might call the subplot of
    Father Ardlui in the novel. It was a theme I thought might form a whole novel, the blasphemous creation and promotion of a new sacred site. That was how
    the priest subplot came about. I admit also that of course people had been saying to me “You write female characters well,” so I thought I would take all
    these elements and invent a female teenage gang, a school choir, going down to Edinburgh for just the day. A whole novel set in twenty four hours. So it is
    a weird amalgamation. I had to invent a large Catholic population in the Port and give a lot of the girls Irish-sounding names to sort of back up the idea
    of a larger Catholic community. I mean you could argue it’s all completely inauthentic – it is a total world of imagination, yet with this weird hard edge
    to it all.
</p>
<p>
    4. Did you enjoy writing any specific Soprano more than the others?
</p>
<p>
    I don’t recall that, no. I mean it was a bit nutty writing that novel. It was a bit like having six younger sisters and I was locked in a linen closet with
them and their voices, going. I mean they all talk. A lot! And I had that in my head for a year. But when I came to write    <em>The Stars in the Bright Sky</em>, it was weird the way Manda took over that novel. All that stuff you might raise your eyebrows at when you see writers
    bellyaching on: “Oh yes, the character just wrote himself” - but it was really like that with Manda, she had just had sort of matured in her levels of
    obnoxiousness. But I liked her.
</p>
<p>
    5.The singing competition - the whole purpose of the Sopranos' journey to the capital - happens off the page. Was there ever an attempt to write this
    scene?
</p>
<p>
    That’s a very interesting point which I had totally forgotten about. As you say, the narrative was pressing towards this flashpoint but I believe it became
    just too obvious to show it. I was sure by then it would seem that disaster for the choir’s performance was inevitable. It was going to be a car crash
    choir final, and I think by skipping it, I threw the reader forward in the narrative and sometimes that’s what you need to do, just throw things on ahead.
    There is also something in the fact that the girls - or at least the sopranos - are so utterly disinterested in the choir competition – they just want to
    be in the big, exciting city – that they were never in the least concerned about the eventual outcome of the competition anyway. They were indifferent,
    though probably even they didn’t think it would be quite as awful as it obviously was. The girls are threatened with expulsion from their school not
    because of losing the choir final, but for changing out of their school uniforms (and losing them) and for getting drunk in Edinburgh. And for Kay vomiting
    just before they go on. I think that’s why I showed the girls singing in unison right at the beginning of the novel when they are gathered in the square,
    then we see them singing in rehearsal at the concert hall when they spy the couple making love outside the window. I must have known then that there was
    going to be no depiction of the final, awful performance and I am sure I never wrote that scene. I guess I felt it was almost a bit corny to show the final
    shame of the choir. Similarly, I didn’t show the confrontational scene – in some ways for me, the dramatic crux of the novel - when the priest, Father
    Ardlui, asks the girls to pretend they have had an ecstatic vision of the Virgin Mary. Which, despite their wildness, they refuse to do. Deep down of
    course, I find this concept very funny.
</p>
<p>
    Your question is very illustrative of what a novel is - and here is a point. In 1998, even before it was published, <em>The Sopranos</em> film rights were
    auctioned in a Hollywood deal through the big CAA agency and all that. They were finally purchased, not by a studio but because I liked him, by the
Scottish film director Michael Caton-Jones. Michael is a very interesting guy who made all these really smart movies, <em>Scandal</em> and    <em>This Boy’s Life</em> based on the great Tobias Wolff book, he also made <em>Doc Hollywood</em> and <em>Rob Roy</em>. Mike’s an interesting guy, the son
    of a coal miner from Broxburn outside Edinburgh, a punk rocker down in London in 1977 who became a roadie in the theatre, ended up at film school and
    eventually a successful director in Hollywood. The movie of <em>The Sopranos</em> never happened - which is a book all in itself. All credit goes to
    Michael, who really stood by his guns against the studios and potential financiers who wanted to change things. But it’s not fair just to blame shadowy
    baddies. Once again it was a very, very difficult novel to adapt and I am not sure we ever got the screenplay right. Alan Sharp, who was a brilliant
    Scottish screenplay writer and wrote interesting novels in the 1960s, did a remarkable screenplay of <em>The Sopranos</em>. (Sadly, Alan recently passed
    away). Alan did fantastic things with the structure – the formal problems of how to assemble a movie which all takes place in one day; but I think there
    were some things that didn’t work about the characters in Alan’s version. Then Michael or a studio commissioned me to take a stab at the screenplay myself.
    I found it extremely difficult, but I mention all this as it is interesting how in both Alan Sharp’s version and in my screenplay, the car crash choir
    final scene was <em>always </em>included. Or in other words invented. That shows the difference between the two forms. If you tried to leave out the choir
    final scene in a movie then the audience would ask the way they don’t in a novel: ‘What happened? Why wasn’t that shown?’ The whole movie would suddenly
    become about what you did not see back at that choir final. You would have to flashback and you don’t want that fouling the forward motion of the film
    narrative. I think in my screenplay version of the choir final, Kay projectile-vomited across the shoulders of the others and into the front audience row,
    whilst they all bravely crashed onward, through Forth Let the Cattle Roam.
</p>
<p>
    Another point if I may. I now believe one of the main reasons that we could never get the screenplay of <em>The Sopranos</em> to fully work is because we
    all dumped the sub plot about Father Ardlui and his nutty attempt to blackmail the girls into lying that they all experienced a religious vision of the
    Holy Mother. At the time I myself thought – ‘right, the first thing we will junk from the screenplay is this whole priest, pilgrimage, holy vision, sub
    plot stuff – we don’t need all that.’ Alan Sharp had jettisoned it too. But I think that was a big mistake of mine. I think the dramatic moment when the
    girls reject Father Ardlui’s attempt to get them to lie is very important. It gives a spine to the story which has been running right through it. It
    wouldn’t have taken that many scenes to create it – not only is it a moral dramatic crux, we gave up a real font of visual possibilities which we could
    have had fun with as Father Ardlui himself imagined how it was all going to look. Maybe we could have got some Vatican funding too? By the way, I don’t
    believe this novel is an attack on the church. It is back to that idea of having themes. I wouldn’t start a novel thinking: ‘As my theme I will attack the
    church’. I just wanted to tell a wee story about how young people really are, not how the church would wish them to be. I have talked with a few practising
    Catholics who were open-minded enough to read the novel and they cautiously agreed with me, especially about the final refusal of the girls to lie about
    the vision. It is interesting that it is this line that these liberated girls finally refuse to cross. It is a novel about wild youth and mad individuals,
    I don’t see it as an attack on an institution - though I can understand it might offend and be thought of in that manner.
</p>
<p>
    6.There are so many mini-stories and episodes in the book that spring from nowhere and could surely be fleshed out into great short stories in their own
    right. The Man and his hash-hunting budgie and the toe-severing incident are just two examples. Does this all crawl from the imagination or do you ever
    borrow from real life?
</p>
<p>
    I was talking about this a bit in relation to <em>Morvern Callar</em> and the same applies, but you seem to have stumbled on a truth as the toe-severing
    incident is indeed true and happened to a friend of mine who will remain comfortably anonymous. In fact he is a source of constant inspiration, this fine
    gentleman. Obviously it’s juggled around a lot and changed. There was no octopus ink, but he did basically perform a naked handstand to try and impress one
    of the wiser sex and promptly in an uncool way, crashed to the floor and sliced off a substantial bit of toe on a bike part. Despite that scene’s root in
    reality though, you will notice there are recurring incidents of dismemberments and mutilations throughout my jolly books. It fascinates me in a horrific
    way, yet I am very squeamish. The budgie thing is completely made up. I am actually extremely protective about animals. Like all dangerous subversives, I’m
    in the RSPCA. My wife and I did have a menagerie of six lovely colourful budgerigars in Ireland. I used to travel around with them in their big cage in the
    back of my car, driving from Dublin to Edinburgh. What a bloody racket they made. I am a sucker for pets and I am hopelessly devoted to them, like our cat.
    I can lose sleep worrying about hungry cats and dogs in the street. I am such a softy. I weep at Eleanor Atkinson’s novel <em>Greyfriars Bobby</em>.

    Their Lips Talk of Mischief (questions contributed by Kirsten Anderson)
</p>
<p>
    The ending leaves the reader guessing what choice Douglas will make. What was your thinking behind leaving things open and were you ever tempted towards a
    more definitive coda?
</p>
<p>
    Well there is this clear hint in the graveyard scene what finally happens to Lou, and I decided to make that explicit quite late on in writing the book, so
    I am afraid even in some quite late drafts of the novel, there really existed a “Thirty-Years-Later” coda, where Douglas visits Lou and Aoife for an
    afternoon in Twyford, near Reading – of all places- where Lou was an English teacher in a local comprehensive. They have had another kid - a teenage son -
    and Lily is a post-grad student. There was even a groansome appearance from Lamborghini the tortoise. It was my Dallas – “the new series” moment. What was
    actually odd about it, was that the emotions of the scene swerved madly around and all were unspoken. Normally that’s a good thing, but here I felt it
    really caused a sort of vacuum of feeling rather than a punch. It was unfocused, there was this strange emotion between Lily and Douglas too, and there
    wasn’t enough time to explore what those emotions were – it was impossible to cram all the exposition which was needed into the scene. It was what made me
    realise I had to take definite action - so in the graveyard scene I made it clear what was soon going to happen to Lou and that totally changed things and
    made the choice Douglas makes all the more crucial as he will be implicated. I wanted it to be quite subtle and just dropped it in there, but in a way it
    is the most crucial sentence in the whole book. Sometimes though, you have to write a scene like that coda to detect exactly where the true ending of any
    novel is. Too many endings is such a risk for fiction. I just read two excellent novels by writers I admire, but they both had - in my opinion - tagged on
    not one extra scene beyond the real ending but two or even three. Let’s face it, sometimes it’s hard to let go in life and in art. Who wants to let go, who
    wants to end that long saxophone solo when it sounds so good? How can you end it? Well as Miles Davis once said – just take the saxophone out of your
    mouth. James Kelman and James M. Cain are very good at endings. They just bring down the chopper and that’s the way a book needs to end. It’s like death
    itself. As a writer you just get all rhetorical at the end. You imagine that when you finally croak, you will be able to nicely collect your thoughts, make
    a speech to the heirs of your vast estates - even if just in your own mind - formulate a nice, rounded conclusion to your time on this fair earth. But only
    suicides get close to that. The rest of us will be cut off, in absurdum, half way through a random act, or thought, during some unremarkable perception or
    in mid-dream whilst asleep. The great dramatic moment of ENDING that we all have waited on and attached such significance to our whole lives, actually
    evaporates and we just disappear. I hope. I could be tortured to death by scalpel-wielding book critics?
</p>
<p>
    The novel is set during the Thatcher years and there are a number of allusions to this social and political backdrop. To what extent are you using this
    backdrop to explain the circumstances and behaviour of the main protagonists?
</p>
<p>
    I don’t think I was at all. In some ways, there are parallels between Aoife’s and Abby’s relationship, and Morvern &amp; Lanna’s: possession, deception,
    jealousy, revelation. I think I am exploring repeated themes in my novels but doing so unconsciously. To be bland, for me there are just always things
    going on with humans that as a novelist, I want to chip away at - what James Kennaway called, “the caveman stuff going on beneath.” That is what is so
    fascinating about reading novels from other ages – the continuity of certain human traits and obsessions placed inside a greater scenario. I am not trying
    to suggest an abstract, continuous human nature exists, but it is so interesting – if <em>Their Lips Talk of Mischief </em>had been set in 1964, 1944, 1884
    or 1774, what would the historical setting do to the characters motivations and conflicts?
</p>
<p>
    I have a prediction this will turn in to a tirade but I wanted to set the novel in 1984 because I lived in London as a student during that period and I saw
    the start of Thatcherism, the miners’ strike, the beginning of social changes and the twisting of social ideology which I have been ill at ease with for so
    long. And not just Thatcher, it became even more extreme in the Blair years of illegal wars. Society is meant to be serving all its citizens for a common
    good. This has been increasingly undermined with brainwashing that we all exist only to serve an economy, (or “fail” in an economy), not to be equal
    members of a decent society. Ideas of a common good in society have been obscured and suppressed by an obsessional worship of - and an unquestioned
    authority of - the free market and profit making, the needs of big business, balancing budgets for some people - but not for all. Everything is now meant
    to produce a profit and that is just illogical thinking. Essentially, many large businesses have become parasites on the correct functioning of our ideas
    of a just society. Today, despite the overall wealth of our world, we are all more and more servants of an unpredictable economy that makes immediate
    demands on the individual, yet promises less and less in return. This isn’t progress. The promises and security of the welfare state in the Britain which
    came out of the second-world-war are being junked while money is lavished on other things. We don’t just have corrupt banks, we have food banks, dodgy loan
    companies replacing the functions of state Social Security – all with the complicity of governments. And to question all of this is to be seen as some sort
    of cranky radical. And the spectacular hypocrisy after decades of this ideology being so dominant, is the way the free market mantra was soon forgotten by
    its high priests the instant the banks went arse over tit in 2008. Suddenly not only the institutions themselves, but certain bankers and others in the
    financial services industry wanted - and got - their huge personal pay and bonuses doled out by the ordinary tax payer. MP’s can fiddle expenses, bankers
    can receive massive subsidy and huge personal bonuses from the tax payer, but someone on the dole down on the estate is always a revolting scrounger. We
    know the truth now: when things go right for the free marketers, they put the money in their pocket, when things go wrong for them, they scream for the
    state purse to help them out. Now I don’t mind a brain surgeon who has studied for decades, receiving a huge wage, but I object to a money-obsessed
    individual who worshipped the free market and bust his bank, getting a massive bonus paid out of public funds - while other people must go to food banks.
    Do the banker with his bonus and the person at the food bank <em>really</em> live in the same society with the same rules anymore? This is a direct line
    from what I saw starting in 1984.

    How do you feel about the many comparisons to <em>Withnail and I</em> that this novel has received? Whilst the novel is permeated with a great deal of
    humour based on the behaviour and antics of the main characters, to what extent would you agree that one of the more serious themes in the novel is the
    development (or lack of development) of individual conscience and personal responsibility?
</p>
<p>
    I am not sure the development of a conscience or personal responsibility is a theme of mine. That’s for the bankers of 2008 to concentrate on! When I am
    thinking about a novel, I sort of live it out in my head to a great extent. I almost see it happening in my head. I am sure this is going to happen or I
    want that to happen. She will say that, he will reply this. It lives quite intently in my head for a spell but then of course I start to write it. I don’t
    think I have ever thought to myself, “The theme of this will be this.” It all seems to stem from the characters. It is almost like you take a photograph of
    a street with shadows on a winter evening and then someone says to you, “Was depression your theme in this photo?” No. I had no theme, I just took the
    photo. I don’t want to seem glib or evasive, but that is sometimes how it feels.
</p>
<p>
    I’ll take it as a compliment for the book to be mentioned in the company of a great film - and writer. Bruce Robinson is a wonderful writer and director,
    and a fascinating man. I adore Withnail but I am also a big fan of Robinson’s forgotten movie, <em>How T0 Get Ahead in Advertising</em>. I do wonder though
    if there is a wee bit of pop-culture laziness - of non-literary response - going on with book critics there. I thought there were more obvious literary
    comparisons - which I happily admit to - like JP Donleavy’s novel <em>The Ginger Man</em> and its main character, Sebastian Dangerfield. I even recall
    saying to a pal who had asked what I was writing, that it was, ‘sort of <em>The Ginger Man</em> in 80s London.’ It was the idea of the bookish, flighty
    male character, vacillating between remorse and indulgence towards his lover, between seething lust and the call of duty: that awful conflict between the
    love for an infant child and the egotistical world of literary fulfilment. All that made me think of Sebastian Dangerfield - not Withnail. Withnail is
    rather hard to think of in terms of fatherhood; can you imagine him even trying to be a father? Oh dear. His solecism is so massive he couldn’t hold it
    down for a moment. But what Cunningham, Abby, Lou and Aoife are doing, is trying to work their way through the requirements of friendship, relationships
    and the responsibilities of caring for an infant child. I think Lou does do his best to live up to his responsibilities, though obviously he doesn’t do
    very well at it. He is fallible as we all are. Lou does love his daughter, but he is being pulled in many directions – including, rightly, by fear of
    death. I would also add that I think there are a few other ingredients in the soup: the spirit of Branwell Bronte - the great underachiever - is always a
    fascination with me, a male fuck up in an amazing family. I reckon there’s a good bit of Orwell’s great <em>Keep the Aspidistra Flying</em> in there too.
    And Flann O’ Brien of course.
</p>
<p>
    Donleavy is currently unfashionable among the reputation-makers in London and Ireland, but I think he has a fine style and I like all his stuff, even the
    recent work. At a ripe old age, he’s still living at Westmeath in that big house of his and I raise my pint to him.
</p>
<p>
    When I first went to live in Dublin - in 1997 - like the good tourist I am, I immediately began draining many pints of Guinness in all the great old Dublin
    pubs - especially ones with literary associations. I began re-reading my favourite Irish books. I should have been paid a monthly stipend by the Irish
    Tourist Board. I reread <em>Dubliners</em> in the back-parlour of Mulligans in Poolbeg Street, which is seemingly unchanged from the day of that great
    story ‘Counterparts,’ when the drunken clerk goes there on a pub crawl and arm wrestles; right there, where I was sitting. I found it remarkable, almost
    dreamlike that those pubs of Beckett and Joyce and Kavanagh were hardly changed. I used to read the poems of another American – John Berryman - in the very
    pub where he wrote some of them, Ryan’s Beggars Bush on Haddington Road. (I recall once, being on a U.S. book tour, arriving at the airport in Minneapolis
    and the young lady driving the car asked if there was anything I wished to see so I replied, ‘Prince’s studio and the bridge Berryman jumped off, please’).
</p>
<p>
    That was a bloody great life back then, happy days - through Dublin I followed the changing addresses of Beckett, Wilde, Moore and Paddy Kavanagh, and all
    those locations of <em>Ulysses</em>.
</p>
<p>
    I had a wild synchronicity in Dublin when I reread <em>The Ginger Man</em>. I had first read it in Oban in 1981 or 82 and of course, I embraced it as I was
    just warming the chestnuts of my own pretentions to become a writer. I had only retained a vague memory of the atmosphere of <em>The Ginger Man</em> - but
    one afternoon, at home, I sat down and began re-reading it after a gap of seventeen or eighteen years. We were then living in Howth, in north Dublin, in
    this great apartment overlooking the sea, on the Balscadden Road. To my amazement, in <em>The Ginger Man’s</em> second chapter you will read that Sebastian
    Dangerfield is also living right on the same Balscadden Road in Howth, yards from where I was sitting
</p>
<p>
    I have lots of odd reading tales like that. You know when I first read <em>Finnegan’s Wake</em> I was at the University in Glasgow. I had hiked the Faber
    edition around with me for a few years, down to London and back up again, and while I am addicted to <em>Ulysses</em> and find it easy to read, I was a bit
    intimidated by The Wake – I carried it around for years but kept putting off starting to read it. I was also aware, from reading Robert Anton Wilson, of
    all the strange, personal associations you can find in its frothed up language. So I finally sat down with a cup of coffee and began reading it in
    Hillhead, Glasgow. On the <em>very</em> first page of <em>Finnegan’s Wake,</em> you will find the word: Hillhead.
</p>
<p>
    I had an even spookier experience another day with a Bob Shaw sci-fi novel in a rented cottage near Oban, but I will spare you the details and you wouldn’t
    believe me.
</p>
<p>
    Abby is sexually uninhibited and confident, whereas Aoife is seemingly very naive and at one point even asks Douglas to explain sexual positions to her.
    Did you want to use the two women to reflect the extent to which the male protagonists develop self-consciousness about the impact of their lifestyle,
    behaviour and actions? Or did you intend for readers to view Aoife as much more manipulative than she appears to be on the surface?
</p>
<p>
    I see what you are saying, but I don’t believe I would develop any character just to reflect an aspect of other characters. That’s what Mrs Micawber does,
    says she will never abandon Mr Micawber and she doesn’t. But that’s all she does as a character. Characters for me have to do their best to come alive as
    autonomous people on the page then bounce off each other. To me Aoife and Abby are just two high school mates who know each other inside out and came down
    to London together, to make it in the big city, yet they are still capable of that element of surprise for one another – which I think can be true of
    friendship and all its attendant jealousies. It is when friendships are tested that the truth of their nature begins to emerge.
</p>
<p>
    You have to be careful as a fiction writer that you don’t end up with just a load of louche characters that the reader does not care about, jumping into
    and out of beds with one another. That’s the problem of pornography. The world is never just about sex and nothing else - but porn pretends – like some
    ridiculous fairy tale - that it is, it pretends that no reality exists beyond sex. That’s why I liked that book by Catherine Millet so much, it wasn’t
    really about sex at all; it was about philosophy and need, and personal psychology. There has to be a meaning as to why characters bed hop. I don’t think
    to get through modern life the best idea is joining a sex cult, and I don’t think we are best taking a vow of celibacy either, the ideal is somewhere in
    between! So I don’t share Abby and Aoife’s preciousness about the sexual act – though you will note that both of them do seem to enjoy – with some gusto -
    breaking the rules when they finally do. Despite that, I think we have to cut Aoife and Lou some slack. They are young and vivacious, but they have been
hobbled by an accidental pregnancy and youthful parenthood. That is a huge thing to cope with and I felt a lot of reviews about    <em>Their Lips Talk of Mischief</em> (but not Brian Morton’s, in The Scottish Review of Books) overlooked the importance of parenthood in the book and its
    demanding, hourly requirements. The looming presence of baby Lily was very important – I mean morally important to me; but a lot of reviewers - even very
    favourable ones - overlooked that.
</p>
<p>
    Lou is painted by our narrator, Douglas, to be violent and neglectful, and undeserving of Aoife’s love. Which is of course manipulative, given Douglas’
    actions later on when he embarks on an affair with her. However, it could also be argued that Lou knew exactly what he was doing when he invited Douglas to
    live with them and left him alone with his wife for long periods. After all, he was bored and looking for excitement and perhaps a way out of the
    relationship, without the guilt. Who do you see as the master manipulator in this novel? The “evil” one, to whom the title refers?
</p>
<p>
    I am not sure that Douglas is such an unreliable narrator – the entire novel seems to amount to some kind of confession where he was simply unable to
    reveal his final act of indulgence and recklessness – which I think led to the tragedy for Lou hinted at in the graveyard. Of course we witness everything
    that happens through the perspective of Douglas, but a great deal of his narration leaves interpretation open for the reader. It is as much what Douglas
    doesn’t write about – what he leaves blank for the reader to fill in- which signals where his guilt and paranoia lies, rather than what he is overt about.
    When Douglas and Aoife shack up together while Lou is away teaching at that language school, we don’t have extensive daily descriptions of Aoife’s and
    Douglas’s little private honeymoon. As well as having sex, Aoife and Douglas must be having conversations – but of course those conversations are never
    reported. Yet Douglas finds himself abandoned the minute Lou returns to London for the funeral. I do think though, that Douglas is trying hard to tell the
    truth about things – he is showing us boldly and not without self-hatred, the lengths people –especially himself - will go to in the spell of lust, in the
    desire to possess another. Douglas shows what he will do to get what he wants or...to get what he thinks he wants - but isn’t quite sure until he tries it.
    People are often surprised to hear me say that though I comprehensively detest Lou’s outbreak of violence towards Aoife, I often feel Douglas is the real
    villain of this novel. Lou struggles very openly with all his worries but Douglas is a bit of smiler with a knife - yet I am not sure I would endorse him
    or anyone as ‘evil’. In a sense, the title is ironic – in the case of strict morality, we are all modern sinners and evil-doers. All of our lips talk of
    mischief constantly. I don’t think there is a master manipulator here unless it is god or the devil. They all have a go, but I think it bites them all in
    the end – only baby Lily is innocent.
